1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,240
After humiliating defeats in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his people that

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,370
the U.S. is bent on destroying the Russian homeland.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,830
On Wednesday, he drafted 300,000 reservists and threatened nuclear war.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,130
“This is not a bluff,” he said.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,450
Ukraine dominated this past week’s annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly in

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,420
New York -- attended by President Biden and more than 120 world leaders.

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:38,079
Friday, we met the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to talk about a world of challenges

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,260
and Putin's nuclear threat.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:52,739
Scott Pelley: How concerned should Americans be about the prospect of nuclear war?

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,069
Antony Blinken: Scott we've heard a lot of irresponsible rhetoric coming out of Vladimir

11
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:03,899
Putin, but we're focused on making sure that we're all acting responsibly, especially when

12
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,940
it comes to this kind of loose rhetoric.

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,050
We have-- been very clear with-- the Russians publicly and-- as well as privately to stop

14
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,030
the loose talk about nuclear weapons.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,720
Scott Pelley: Privately, the United States has been in communication with the Kremlin

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,750
about these threats of nuclear war?

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,750
Antony Blinken: Yes.

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,150
It's very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,640
would be horrific.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,980
And we've made that very clear.

21
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,590
Scott Pelley: You call the nuclear talk "loose talk."

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,580
But isn't Vladimir Putin telling us what he's going to do if he is backed any further into

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,580
a corner?

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,010
Antony Blinken: Vladimir Putin has a clear way out of the war he started and that's to

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,010
end it.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,580
If Russia stops fighting, the war ends.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,980
If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,210
Scott Pelley: Is there anyone in the Kremlin who can tell Vladimir Putin “No" if he decides

29
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,400
to launch a battlefield nuclear weapon?

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Antony Blinken: They have a chain of command.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,950
Whether it works or not-- to be seen.

32
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,610
But I think what you're pointing to is a larger challenge.

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,209
And that is the Achilles heel of autocracies anywhere, there is usually not anyone who

34
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,099
has the capacity or the will to speak truth to power, And part of the reason I think--

35
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,069
Russia has gotten itself into the mess that it's in is because there is no one in the

36
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,520
system to effectively tell Putin he's doing the wrong thing.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,150
Scott Pelley: In our interview last week, President Biden told us that he had a message

38
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,400
for Vladimir Putin on the use of nuclear weapons.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,420
President Joe Biden: Don’t, Don’t, Don’t.

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,980
Scott Pelley: He went on to say, the U.S. response would be consequential.

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,629
What did he mean by that?

42
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,980
Antony Blinken: I'm not gonna get into what the consequences would be- any use of nuclear

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,020
weapons would have catastrophic effects for -- of course the country using them-- but

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
for many others as well.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,980
Scott Pelley: If you can't give us specifics about a U.S. response, can you tell us that

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,540
the administration has a plan?

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,090
Antony Blinken: We do.

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,749
Scott Pelley: Is it a plan that would prevent World War III?

49
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:21,420
Antony Blinken: President Biden has been determined that as we're doing everything we can to help

50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,840
the Ukrainians defend themselves, as we're doing everything we can to rally other countries

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,430
to put pressure on Russia, we're also determined that this war not expand, not get broader.

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,719
As we were speaking to Secretary Blinken, news broke that a U.N. investigative commission

53
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,950
had found evidence of rape and torture of children in Russian-occupied Ukraine.

54
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,840
Scott Pelley: The panel goes on to say, "Based on the evidence gathered by the commission,

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,079
it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine."

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,590
What does justice look like for Ukraine?

57
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:08,389
Antony Blinken: Justice looks like accountability, accountability for those who perpetrated these

58
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,230
war crimes, these atrocities, as well as for those who ordered them.

59
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,930
And it's one of the reasons, Scott, why-- we're doing everything we can to support those

60
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,069
who are trying to compile the evidence.

61
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,580
And to investigate.

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,620
And ultimately, to prosecute those responsible.

63
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,800
Scott Pelley: To prosecute?

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
You believe there should be war crime trials?

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,910
Antony Blinken: I was in Ukraine a couple of weeks ago.

66
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,639
One of the places I visited was a city called Irpin, And I saw residential buildings, building

67
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,250
block after building block, totally bombed out this was the totally indiscriminate use

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,960
of force.

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,259
wherever the Russian tide recedes, what's left in its wake is very clear evidence of

70
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,900
atrocities and war crimes.

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,711
Atrocities were laid before the U.N Security Council last Thursday, drawing from the Russian

72
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:01,419
foreign minister a dubious defense.

73
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:08,360
Scott Pelley: When Sergey Lavrov says that, the atrocities have been staged and it is

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,840
Russia that is the victim, Tony Blinken is sitting there thinking what?

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
Antony Blinken: This is “Alice in Wonderland.”

76
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,770
It's the world upside down.

77
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,310
Up is down, white is black-- truth is false.

78
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,710
But here's the thing, Scott.

79
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,479
All of these words, all of these words ring totally hollow to every member on the Security

80
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,479
Council.

81
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,849
So this spewing of words-- is not having an effect.

82
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:46,530
On the contrary, I think it just shows the total disconnect between Russia and virtually

83
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,879
the entirety of the rest of the world.

84
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:55,300
At the moment we spoke to the secretary, Russia was hurrying through what it calls “elections”

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,560
to force these areas of Ukraine's occupied east and south into the Russian Federation.

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,210
Antony Blinken: These so-called elections are a sham, period.

87
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,389
They go in.

88
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,530
They put in puppet governments, local governments.

89
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,939
And then they proceed with a vote, which they'll manipulate in any event in order to try to

90
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,210
declare the territory Russian territory.

91
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,580
It is not.

92
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,490
It will never be recognized as such.

93
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,650
And the Ukrainians have every right to take it back.

94
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,599
Blinken came to our interview after meeting China's foreign minister.

95
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,310
China has been raising pressure on the democratic island of Taiwan which, in our conversation

96
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,699
last week, President Biden pledged to defend with force.

97
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:48,939
Scott Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would

98
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,080
defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,050
President Joe Biden: Yes.

100
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,800
But official U.S. policy is, and has been for decades, to remain ambiguous about defending

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
the island.

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,689
Antony Blinken: China has acted increasingly aggressively when it comes to Taiwan.

103
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,770
That poses a threat to peace and stability in the entire region.

104
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,129
Scott Pelley: The Chinese foreign minister must have asked you to explain the President's

105
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:14,129
remarks.

106
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:20,819
Antony Blinken: Well, we had a conversation about our different approaches-- to Taiwan,

107
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,719
and I reiterated what-- what the President has said, and what he's said clearly and consistently.

108
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:34,349
Our continued adherence to the-- the One China Policy-- our determination that-- the differences

109
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:41,729
be resolved peacefully-- our insistence-- that peace and stability be maintained in

110
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:47,379
the Taiwan Straits, and our deep concern that China was taking actions to try to change

111
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,530
that status quo.

112
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,979
That's what the issue is.

113
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,189
Blinken warns that turbulence in the Taiwan Strait would wash around the world.

114
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:02,319
Antony Blinken: Taiwan itself, were anything to happen, it is where virtually all the semiconductors--

115
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,449
are-- are made.

116
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,159
One of the-- one of the reasons we're now investing so heavily in our own capacity to

117
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,259
produce semiconductors here in the United States.

118
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,590
We designed them, but the actual production is done in a handful of places, and Taiwan

119
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,759
produces most of them if that’s disrupted the effects that that would have on the global

120
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,030
economy could be devastating.

121
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,249
Last week on 60 Minutes, the president of Iran told Lesley Stahl he would consider re-entering

122
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,070
the deal to restrict Iran's nuclear weapons program.

123
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,659
The Trump administration had canceled it.

124
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,099
Blinken doubts that Iran is serious.

125
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:44,560
Antony Blinken: Iran has continued to try to add extraneous issues to the negotiation

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,630
that we're simply not going to say yes to.

127
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,829
We will not accept a bad deal, the response that they've given to the last proposals put

128
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,209
forward by our European partners have been a very significant step backwards.

129
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:03,829
And so, I don't see any prospects in the very near term to-- to bring this to a conclusion.

130
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,839
Antony Blinken is 60.

131
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,769
One of his grandparents was born in Ukraine, his stepfather survived the Holocaust.

132
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,709
And his father was a U.S. ambassador.

133
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:20,290
Blinken has spent 30 years in foreign policy for Democrats mostly in the Senate and the

134
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,290
White House.

135
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,769
He was in the back of the room during the strike on Osama Bin Laden.

136
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:34,850
His philosophy on American diplomacy is robust engagement with what he calls, humility and

137
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,850
confidence.

138
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,060
Antony Blinken: If we don't engage, if we're not leading, then one of two things, either

139
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,080
someone else is and probably not in a way that's gonna advance our interests and values,

140
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,940
or no one is, and then you tend to have chaos.

141
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,350
You get a vacuum that's filled by bad things before it's filled with good things.

142
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,910
Because the world does not organize itself.

143
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,550
There's not a single big problem that's affecting the lives of our citizens that we can effectively

144
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,030
solve alone.

145
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,420
Whether it's climate, whether it's COVID, whether it's the effect of all of these emerging

146
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,980
technologies on our lives, we have to be working with others to try to shape all of this in

147
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,529
a way that's actually gonna make our people, as well as other people, a little bit more

148
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,660
secure, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more full of opportunity.

149
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:27,370
Scott Pelley: Given January 6th, given the fabricated controversy over the election results,

150
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,649
do you find that countries around the world are worried about the stability of the United

151
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:34,649
States?

152
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,389
Antony Blinken: It's no secret that we have challenges within our own democracy.

153
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,810
They're playing out before the entire world.

154
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,630
We don't sweep them under the rug, even when it's painful.

155
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,820
So I'm able to say to other countries that bring these up, yes, we've got our problems,

156
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,209
but we're confronting them.

157
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,530
We're dealing with them.

158
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,010
You might do the same thing.

159
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,980
Scott Pelley: Your father was U.S. ambassador to Hungary.

160
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,040
And as we sit here on Friday afternoon, he passed away last night.

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,199
And I wonder why you decided to keep such a busy schedule the day after that tragedy

162
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:16,350
in your family.

163
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,310
Antony Blinken: My dad was 96 years old.

164
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:29,250
He was in so many ways my role model. he built a remarkable business, one of the leading

165
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:36,889
investment banks in this country over many years, He led a life of dignity, of decency,

166
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,110
of modesty that is something I've very much aspired to.

167
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,920
And so I-- I guess I thought that -- honoring everything that he shared with me, the best

168
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
way to do that was to continue doing my job.

169
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,860
That job, for the foreseeable future, will be consumed with a question that has defeated

170
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,120
generations of diplomats—how to keep a small war in Europe from igniting the world.

171
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,100
Scott Pelley: Are there any talks currently that we may not have heard about?

172
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,009
Antony Blinken: There are no talks because Russia has not demonstrated any willingness

173
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:15,890
in this moment to engage in meaningful discussions.

174
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,660
If and when that changes, we will do everything we can to support a diplomatic process.

175
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,850
Scott Pelley: Is Vladimir Putin losing this war?

176
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,399
Antony Blinken: He's already lost in terms of what he was trying to achieve.

177
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,850
Because keep in mind, what he said very clearly from the start is, his objective was to erase

178
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,050
Ukraine's identity as an independent country, that has already failed.

179
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,779
Ukrainians are fighting for their own land.

180
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,610
They're fighting for their own country.

181
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,570
The Russians are not.

182
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,440
And these Russian soldiers who are being thrown into this conflict, often not knowing where

183
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,130
they're going or what they're doing-- this is not something that they want to be fighting

184
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,320
for.

185
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,570
The Ukrainians are fighting for their own future.

186
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,490
They're fighting for their own land.

187
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,560
They're fighting for their own lives.
