1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,600
in his first 100 days president biden focused on  the coronavirus pandemic but over the course of  

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,760
his term the biden presidency will be defined  by how the united states competes with china  

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,040
in a few years china's economy is expected  to surpass the u.s as the world's biggest  

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,280
to determine how the united states will deal with  china's growing influence mr biden has chosen one  

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,760
of his closest aides as secretary of state it  falls to anthony blinken to rebuild a depleted  

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,240
and demoralized state department repair u.s  alliances and champion what diplomats call the  

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,000
rules-based international order the written and  unwritten code that governs how nations deal with  

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,400
one another rules that he says are now threatened  by china the story will continue in a moment

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,160
it is the one country in the world that has  the military economic diplomatic uh capacity to  

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,720
undermine or challenge the rules-based order that  we uh we care so much about and are determined  

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,800
to defend but i want to be very clear about  something and this is important our purpose is not  

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,960
to contain china to hold it back to keep it  down it is to uphold this rules-based order  

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,520
that china is posing a challenge to anyone who  poses a challenge to that order we're going to  

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,360
stand up and defend it i know you say the goal is  not to contain china but have you ever seen china  

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,600
be so assertive or aggressive militarily no we  haven't i think what we've witnessed over the last  

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:53,040
several years is china acting more repressively at  home and more aggressively abroad that is a fact  

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,640
what's china's goal i think that over time  china believes that it it can be and should  

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,880
be and will be the dominant country in the world  chinese fighter jets are increasingly visible  

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,680
in the skies above the western pacific  where the u.s navy also has a presence  

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,080
this past week china's president xi unveiled  three new warships to patrol the south china sea  

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,640
it already has the world's largest navy and could  use it to invade taiwan a democratic island and  

22
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,160
long-standing u.s ally do you think we're heading  towards some sort of military confrontation with  

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
china i think it's profoundly against the  interests of both china and the united states  

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,880
uh to uh to get to that point or even to  head in that direction let's talk about human  

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,080
rights describe what you see it's happening in  xinjiang that maybe the rest of the world doesn't  

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,480
we've made clear that um we see a genocide having  taken place against uh the uyghurs in xinjiang  

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
more than a million people have been put  into choose your term concentration camps  

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,000
re-education camps internment camps when  beijing says oh there's a terrorism threat  

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,280
which we don't see it's not coming from a million  people our administration six weeks ago in alaska  

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,680
secretary blinken confronted young giache  china's top diplomat about genocide in xinjiang  

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,440
and china's military aggression we feel an  obligation to raise these issues here today

32
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,120
the exchange became an international incident  caught on camera and not lost in translation  

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,480
the united states does not have the qualification  to say that it wants to speak to china from a  

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,200
position of strength if shinzone is in a red line  with china then what is look we don't have the  

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,040
luxury of not dealing with china there are real  complexities to the relationship whether it's the  

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,960
adversarial piece whether it's the competitive  piece whether it's the the cooperative piece  

37
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,520
even before the meeting in alaska president  xi had warned about the dawn of a new cold war  

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,480
during president trump's time in office  china found the u.s less predictable than  

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,080
past administrations and i just announced another  10 tariffs mr trump imposed tariffs on hundreds  

40
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,840
of billions of dollars of chinese products in  response to what he called unfair trade practices  

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,480
and the theft of u.s intellectual property so far  the biden administration has kept the tariffs in  

42
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,080
place i also told president xi that we'll maintain  a strong military presence china may be the only  

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,240
big issue of the day in washington in which  democrats and republicans find common cause  

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,320
the chinese have stolen hundreds of billions  if not trillions of dollars of trade secrets  

45
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,760
and intellectual property from the united states  that sounds like the actions of an enemy certainly  

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,040
sounds like the actions of of someone who's  trying to compete unfairly uh and increasingly in  

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,760
adversarial ways but we're much more effective  and stronger when we're bringing like-minded  

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,560
and similarly aggrieved countries together to say  to beijing this can't stand and it won't stand  

49
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,360
so is that a message that president biden has  delivered to president xi certainly in their in  

50
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,720
their first conversation uh they covered a lot  of ground it was a reportedly a two-hour phone  

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,560
call it was yeah i was there and so did president  biden tell president xi to cut it out president  

52
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,200
biden made clear that in a number of areas we have  real concerns about the actions that china has  

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,600
taken and that includes in the economic area and  that includes the theft of intellectual property  

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,040
china's gross domestic product is expected  to surpass the united states as early as 2028  

55
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,720
well it's a large country it's got a lot of  people if china becomes the wealthiest country  

56
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,880
in the world doesn't that also make it the most  powerful a lot depends on how it uses that wealth  

57
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,720
it has an aging population it has significant  uh environmental problems and so on but here's  

58
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,360
the way i think about it nor writ large if we're  talking about what really makes the wealth of a  

59
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,760
nation fundamentally it's it's human resources and  the ability of any one country to maximize their  

60
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,520
potential that's the challenge uh for us it's the  challenge for china i think we're in a much better  

61
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,520
place to maximize that uh that human potential  than any country on earth if we're smart about it  

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,760
china thinks long-term strategically decades  in advance is america just caught up on  

63
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,640
the latest fires here and there and we're not  thinking long term strategically and as a result  

64
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
china will surpass us what i  found looking at our own history  

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,880
is that when we've confronted a significant  challenge significant competition uh significant  

66
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,760
adversity we've managed to come together and  actually do the long-term thinking the long-term  

67
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,240
investment and that is really the moment we're in  now and that's the test that i think we're facing  

68
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
are we actually going to rise to  it president biden believes we are  

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
anthony blinken occupies a suite of offices  on the seventh floor of the state department  

70
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,840
but he first worked for joe biden at the senate  foreign relations committee nearly 20 years ago  

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,600
and has barely left his side since in the obama  white house secretary blinken held concurrent  

72
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,760
roles as an assistant to the president and the  national security advisor for vice president biden  

73
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,480
it's been the most consequential professional  relationship and and also in many ways personal  

74
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,080
relationship uh that i've uh that i've had how  often do you speak it's pretty close to daley you  

75
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,480
speak to him every day in one way or another  you know we're we're pretty good at meetings  

76
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
so there are a few of those when i thought  about the relationship that you have had  

77
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,280
with with president biden over the years in  the senate and then when he was vice president  

78
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,440
the only relationship that i could come up with  though i'm not a historian um was of course  

79
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,640
secretary baker and president george h.w bush  i'd be flattered by any comparison to secretary  

80
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,840
baker i actually i spoke to him on the phone a few  months ago and we talked about the importance of  

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,040
ideally a secretary of state having a close  relationship with uh with the president  

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,120
he was extraordinarily effective for all  sorts of reasons but that was i think a source  

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,040
of his effectiveness secretary of state  james baker helped president george h.w bush  

84
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,640
end the cold war with the soviet union the  current secretary is in the midst of winding  

85
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:46,000
down america's longest war in afghanistan are you  prepared for a worst case scenario in afghanistan  

86
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,480
where the u.s backed government fails  and the taliban takes over we have to  

87
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,280
be prepared for every scenario and there are a  range of them and uh we we're looking at this  

88
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,240
uh in a very clear-eyed way but nora we've  been engaged in afghanistan for 20 years and  

89
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,040
we sometimes forget why we went there in the first  place and that was to deal with the people who  

90
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,200
attacked us on 9 11. and we did just because our  troops are coming home doesn't mean we're leaving  

91
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,000
we're not our embassy's staying the support that  we're giving to afghanistan when it comes to  

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,320
economic support development humanitarian that  that remains and not only from us from partners  

93
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,720
and allies somewhat related will the biden  administration close guantanamo bay we believe  

94
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,960
that it should be that's certainly a goal but  it's something that we'll bring some focus to in  

95
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,960
the months ahead in this past wednesday's address  to congress president biden spoke about his plans  

96
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,240
for immigration reform for more than 30 years  politicians have talked about immigration reform  

97
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,960
and we've done nothing about it it's time to fix  it it's a subject not usually central to the state  

98
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,760
department's mission but we asked secretary  blinken about it because of the refugee crisis  

99
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,000
on america's southern border border crossings  for undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed  

100
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,640
in march more than a hundred and seventy thousand  people were taken into custody that's the highest  

101
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,080
in 20 years are the policies of  the bidet administration to blame  

102
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,600
no what we're seeing is indeed a surge of people  to the border we've seen that in the past but  

103
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:39,760
we inherited a totally broken system uh broken  intentionally and it takes time to fix it and by  

104
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,840
the way our message is very clear don't come the  border is not open you won't get in but we have to  

105
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,760
understand what is motivating so many people to do  this and it is usually desperation but that's not  

106
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,640
new i want to talk about the policies of the biden  administration because president biden did use his  

107
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:06,640
executive authority to curb deportations to allow  more asylum seekers to enter the united states  

108
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,560
so are these new policies by the administration  contributing to this surge we're focused when it  

109
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,600
comes to people coming into making sure that that  children unaccompanied minors are treated humanely  

110
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,520
and according to the law is it problematic  to tell migrants well no you can't come here  

111
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,360
and then at the same time create a different  situation on the ground that does allow them  

112
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,240
to come but the point is that they're not and  what's one of the challenges that uh that we've  

113
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,960
had is that um traffickers and others are trying  to tell them that the border is open it's not but  

114
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,120
children are being allowed in and they're being  children are the one exception because we we will  

115
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,360
not it is the it is the right thing to do we are  not going to abide the notion that children are  

116
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,400
kept in a precarious dangerous situation that is  unacceptable blinken himself is a father of two  

117
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,040
young children and hails from a family that only  a few generations ago were themselves refugees his  

118
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,840
paternal great grandfather meyer blinken emigrated  to new york city from ukraine fleeing russian  

119
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,960
oppression in 1904 this coming week the secretary  of state will visit ukraine to show support for  

120
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,920
the country currently in the throes of more recent  russian aggression president putin has amassed a  

121
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,280
very large force at the border with ukraine more  than a hundred thousand troops what is putin up to

122
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,520
you're right there are more forces massed on  the border with ukraine than any time since  

123
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,240
2014 when russia actually invaded i can't  tell you that we know mr putin's intentions  

124
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,960
there are any number of things that he could  do or or choose not to do what we have seen in  

125
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,080
the last few days is apparently a decision to  pull back some of those forces and we've seen some  

126
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,800
of them in fact start to pull back that's been  verified that they are pulling back starting now  

127
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,360
we're watching that very very carefully

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
secretary blinken on china's  influence in hong kong  

129
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,760
i think there'll be an economic  blow back at 60 minutesovertime.com
