1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,589
Mark Esper is a Washington insider who spent his whole career flying below the radar – until

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,590
he became President Donald Trump’s second secretary of defense.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,490
A West Point graduate and paratrooper, Esper spent 10 years as a by-the-book Army officer.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,640
And when he left active duty, he moved through the revolving doors of think tank jobs, Capitol

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
Hill & Pentagon staff positions, and defense lobbying.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,529
It all turned out to be boot camp for his assignment as defense secretary -- and a face-off

7
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,410
with Mr. Trump, whom he came to regard as a threat to American democracy.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:44,399
But we begin tonight with the former defense secretary's thoughts on Russia's war in Ukraine.

9
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:54,329
Norah O'Donnell: Overall, how would you grade President Biden and his administration's--

10
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,950
performance in terms of Ukraine?

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,199
Mark Esper: It's mixed.

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,420
They had a shaky start.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,780
I would've never taken the military option off the table, for example.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,890
I don't understand the reluctance to provide-- the Ukrainians with MiGs

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,890
Norah O'Donnell: Fighter jets.

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,920
Mark Esper: Fighter jets, that's right.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
But-- since then, it's picked up.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,509
I think we're now flowing more supplies and material and weapons into Ukraine.

19
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,430
I think they've done a good job of bringing the allies along, which is important.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,960
You-- you have to act collectively.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,071
And you have to give some credit, by the way, to the Congress, which I think-- you know,

22
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:29,520
in the few-- few issues that has unified Congress has been this one, support for Ukraine.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,939
And in some ways, they've led the administration.

24
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:36,810
So it's good to see now Congress and the Executive Branch-- acting together, reasonably aligned,

25
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,290
to help the Ukrainian people.

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,710
Tomorrow, May 9, marks an important day on the Russian calendar, victory in World War

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
II.

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,899
Mark Esper: Well, I think the conventional wisdom right now seems to be that by May 9th--

29
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:53,859
Putin is gonna try and secure Donbass, which would be-- occupying the rest of the Donetsk

30
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,860
and Luhansk provinces, if you will, and declare them protected.

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,170
Norah O'Donnell: Is there any scenario where President Putin could take those regions and

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,350
then just declare victory?

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,590
Mark Esper: Absolutely, absolutely.

34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean, if I were a betting man today, I'd say that is what he will do.

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,970
He'll at least secure the-- all of Donbass, declare that he's liberated the Russian-speaking

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,770
peoples of that region, and declare victory.

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,550
And that will become another frozen conflict.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,050
Mark Esper’s time as secretary of defense began when he was overwhelmingly confirmed

39
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,230
by the Senate, 90-8, on July 23, 2019.

40
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,960
Two days later, on a phone call with President Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump asked for a “favor”

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,900
while he was holding up aid to Ukraine.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,330
The call ultimately led to his impeachment.

43
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,750
Norah O'Donnell: You had to keep pressing President Trump to release $250 million in

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
aid to Ukraine?

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,580
Mark Esper: Yes, it would be an argument after an argument.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,910
And I'd have to say, "Look, Mr. President, at the end of the day, Congress appropriated.

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,220
It's-- it's the law.

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,310
We have to do it."

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,880
Esper writes in his new memoir, “A Sacred Oath,” that the Ukraine affair was an early

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,520
source of tension between him and President Trump.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,140
That tension would grow, as he told us when we met him at his alma mater, West Point.

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,720
Mark Esper: Because It's important to our country, it's important to the republic, the

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,230
American people, that they understand what was going on in this very consequential period.

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,310
The last year of the Trump administration.

55
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,180
And to tell the story about things we prevented.

56
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
Really bad things.

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,780
Dangerous things that could have taken the country in-- in a dark direction.

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,140
Norah O'Donnell: What kind of terrible things did you prevent?

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,310
Mark Esper: At various times-- during the-- certainly the last year of the administration,

60
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,810
you know, folks in the White House are proposing to take military action against Venezuela.

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,680
To-- to-- to strike Iran.

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,240
At one point, somebody propose we blockade Cuba.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,860
These ideas would happen-- it seemed, every-- every few weeks.

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,170
Something like this would come up and we'd have to swat 'em down.

65
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,090
Norah O'Donnell: Who's "we had to swat 'em down?"

66
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,800
Mark Esper: Well, mostly me.

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I had good support from-- from General Mark Milley.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley ran the Army

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,550
for over a year before finding themselves in charge at the Pentagon.

70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,450
in order to deal with what he calls some of the “crazy” ideas coming from the White

71
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,580
House, Esper and Milley came up with a system.

72
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,650
Mark Esper: I come up with this idea.

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,230
Actually, Mark Milley and I discuss it-- what we call the "Four No's".

74
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,319
The four things we had to prevent from happening between then and the election.

75
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:31,199
And one was no strategic retreats, no unnecessary wars, no politi-- politicization of the military,

76
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
and no misuse of the military.

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,400
And so, as we went through the next five to six months, that became the metric by which

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,909
we would measure things.

79
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:45,090
Esper told us he had reason to be concerned, not just about an unnecessary military conflict

80
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,150
with an adversary but with one of our closest neighbors and largest trading partners.

81
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,870
Mark Esper: The president pulls me aside on at least a couple of occasions and suggests

82
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,000
that maybe we have the U.S. military shoot missiles into Mexico--

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,409
Norah O'Donnell: Shoot missiles into Mexico for what?

84
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,050
Mark Esper: He would say to-- to go after the cartels.

85
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,509
And we would have this private discussion where I'd say, "Mr. President, I-- you know,

86
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,379
I-- I understand the motive."

87
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,379
Because he was very serious about dealing with drugs in America.

88
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,419
I get that, we all understand, but I had to explain to him, "We-- we can't do that.

89
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,000
It would violate international law.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,520
It would be terrible for our neighbors to the south.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,659
It would, you know, impact us in so many ways.

92
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,189
Why-- why don't we do this instead?"

93
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,270
Norah O'Donnell: You politely push back on the idea.

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,930
Did President Trump really say, "No one would know it was us?"

95
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,090
Mark Esper: Yes.

96
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,090
Yes.

97
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,289
I-- I-- he-- he said that.

98
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,530
And I-- I just thought it was fanciful, right?

99
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,110
Because, of course, it would be us.

100
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,509
I was reluctant to tell this story.

101
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,499
Because I think-- I-- I thought, people won't believe this.

102
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:50,090
That they'll think I'm just making it up and folks in-- in-- in Trump's orbit will-- will

103
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,090
dispute it.

104
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,349
And then I was having dinner-- after the election in 2020 with a fellow Cabinet member.

105
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,000
And-- and he said to me, he goes, "You know, remember that time when President Trump suggested

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,440
you shoot mess-- m-- missiles into Mexico?"

107
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,889
And I said to him, "You-- you heard that?"

108
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:06,889
He goes, "Oh, yeah.

109
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:07,909
I-- I couldn't believe it.

110
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,779
And I couldn't believe how-- how well you managed and talked him down from that."

111
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,479
And at that moment, I knew I gotta write the story.

112
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,150
Because at least have one witness who will verify that this really did happen.

113
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,039
When asked whether Esper’s story about Mexico was true, Donald Trump said in a statement

114
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,879
to 60 Minutes, “no comment.”

115
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,749
Esper says to fact-check his book, he sent all – or parts of -- his manuscript to more

116
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:35,479
than two dozen current and former four-star officers, senior civilians from the Pentagon,

117
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,759
and cabinet members.

118
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,830
60 Minutes spoke to six of them who said what they read was accurate.

119
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,569
During the late spring of 2020, it was not a foreign crisis, but the murder of George

120
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,860
Floyd in Minneapolis, that Esper calls a turning point in his time as secretary of defense.

121
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,259
On the night of May 31 in Washington, protests for racial justice were marred by rioters

122
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,699
who set parts of Washington ablaze and, Esper says, enraged President Trump.

123
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,499
At a meeting the next morning, Esper told us, the commander-in-chief was on the verge

124
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,050
of ordering 10,000 active-duty troops into the streets of the Capital.

125
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,370
Norah O'Donnell: What was the most disturbing thing that the president said during that

126
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,430
meeting on June 1st?

127
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,490
Mark Esper: The president is ranting at-- at the room.

128
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,500
He's using a lot of, you know-- foul language.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,139
You know, "You-- y-- you all are f-in' losers," right?

130
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,620
And then he says it to the vice president, Mike Pence.

131
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,289
He-- he's usin' the same language and he's lookin' at Pence.

132
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,849
Norah O'Donnell: He called Mike Pence--

133
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,849
Mark Esper: H-- he di--

134
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:38,849
Norah O'Donnell: --an f-in' loser?

135
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,969
Mark Esper: --he didn't-- he didn't call him directly, but he was looking at him when he

136
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,499
was saying it.

137
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:46,840
And it really caught my attention, and I thought, that-- we're at a different spot now.

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,190
He's gonna finally give a direct order to deploy paratroopers into the streets of Washington,

139
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,190
D.C.

140
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,439
And I'm thinking with weapons and bayonets.

141
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,949
This would be horrible.

142
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,110
Norah O'Donnell: What specifically was he suggesting that the U.S. military should do

143
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,199
to these protesters?

144
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,770
Mark Esper: He says, "Can't you just shoot them?

145
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,909
Just shoot them in the legs or something."

146
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,800
And he's suggesting that that's what we should do, that we should bring in the troops and

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,990
shoot the protesters.

148
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,430
Norah O'Donnell: The commander in chief was suggesting that the U.S. military shoot protesters?

149
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,430
American protesters.

150
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,860
Mark Esper: Yes, in the streets--

151
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,860
Norah O'Donnell: American protesters.

152
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,909
Mark Esper: --of our nation's capital.

153
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:24,909
That's right.

154
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:25,909
Shocking.

155
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:32,750
Norah O'Donnell: We have seen in other countries a government use their military to shoot protesters.

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,750
Mark Esper: Right.

157
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
Norah O'Donnell: What kinda governments are those?

158
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,030
Mark Esper: Oh, those are banana republics, right?

159
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,190
Or-- authoritarian regimes.

160
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,810
We all remember Tiananmen Square, right, in China

161
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,270
Regarding whether he suggested shooting protesters, in his statement, former President Trump said,

162
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,590
“this is a complete lie, and 10 witnesses can back it up.

163
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:57,250
Mark Esper was weak and totally ineffective, and because of it, i had to run the military.”

164
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,320
Esper told us he wanted to avoid the president invoking the Insurrection Act, which would

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,370
have allowed Mr. Trump to deploy active-duty troops.

166
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,090
Instead, Esper says he helped mobilize 5,000 members of the national guard whose mission

167
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,700
includes responding to civil unrest.

168
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,720
And to placate Mr. Trump, Esper writes he also ordered part of the 82nd Airborne up

169
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
from Ft.

170
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,850
Bragg, North Carolina to a base just outside Washington.

171
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,130
That evening, the U.S. Park Police used force to clear protestors from Lafayette Park and

172
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,700
the Cabinet was called back to the White House.

173
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,560
Mark Esper: The president greets us.

174
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,990
And I say, "Where are we going?"

175
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,850
And he-- he just ignores it and starts walking out the door and crossing across the-- the

176
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,150
lawn heading out the gate.

177
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,890
And as we round that corner the press is all over-- all over the place filming, taking

178
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,890
pictures.

179
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,201
And it-- it just dawned on me at that point in time that we'd been duped.

180
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,201
Norah O'Donnell: Duped how?

181
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:58,720
Mark Esper: This is a pol-- this is now a political stunt, right?

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,450
And-- and w-- we-- I allowed myself to be put in that position.

183
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,750
And it only gets worse, right?

184
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,130
Norah O'Donnell: How does it get worse?

185
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,120
Mark Esper: Well, we end up in Lafayette Park-- up near the church.

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,890
And that's where the president steps out of the crowd, if you will, goes up, picks up

187
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,480
the Bible and holds it up for everybody to see and I eventually get directed to come

188
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,870
up and join him.

189
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,550
And-- I made that mistake to-- to kinda be there in the first place and to join him.

190
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,990
Within 24 hours, Esper says he sent out a message to employees of the Department of

191
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,280
Defense reminding them they must remain apolitical and protect freedom of speech.

192
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,700
Then he decided, that wasn’t enough.

193
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,580
Mark Esper: The Republic felt wobbly.

194
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,240
And that's what prompted me to decide to-- to go before the podium at the Pentagon on

195
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,390
June 3rd and say what I said.

196
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,710
Mark Esper on June 3, 2020: The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement

197
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,690
role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire

198
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,870
of situations.

199
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,060
We are not in one of those situations now.

200
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,350
I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.

201
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,270
Right after that, Esper was summoned to the White House.

202
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,850
He says he was sure Donald Trump would fire him.

203
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,290
Norah O'Donnell: Why did you think he would fire you?

204
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,830
Mark Esper: Because I publicly rebuked him.

205
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:20,010
And what I would learn later is-- at the White House is he thought I took away his authority

206
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,320
to invoke the Insurrection Act.

207
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,990
He did not believe that he had the authority to impose it.

208
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,120
Norah O'Donnell: Politically, you might have.

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,790
Mark Esper: I suppose at a political level, I-- I did.

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,260
But he still had that authority.

211
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,080
What he also knew was I wasn't gonna go along with him.

212
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,970
Esper believes President Trump didn’t fire him at the time because it may have hurt Mr.

213
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,120
Trump’s chances for re-election.

214
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,990
Esper also told us he did not vote for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump, but mailed in a

215
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,590
ballot for another candidate.

216
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,190
Norah O'Donnell: You're a lifelong Republican.

217
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,430
But in this book, you detail how you subverted many of the president's wishes.

218
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,470
People will say you were disloyal.

219
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,630
Mark Esper: I never disobeyed a direct order from the president of the United States.

220
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,660
I was fortunate that he often didn't give direct orders.

221
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,390
But otherwise, I did what I thought was best for the nation and for our security, and completely

222
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,770
within the authority granted to me under the law.

223
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,410
Norah O'Donnell: Critics will say, "Why now in a book?

224
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,230
Why didn't you speak out during the Trump administration?"

225
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,100
Mark Esper: It's very simple.

226
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,820
If I spoke out at the time, I would be fired, number one.

227
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,690
And secondly, I had no confidence that anybody that came in behind me would not be a real

228
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,300
Trump loyalist.

229
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,520
And Lord knows what would've happened then.

230
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,360
Esper says six days after the election, he and his staff could hardly believe they were

231
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
still at the Pentagon.

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,290
Then he got word that the president planned to fire him.

233
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,990
The phone rang and Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was on the line.

234
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,210
Norah O'Donnell: You write in the book, he says, "The president's not happy with you.

235
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,740
He feels you haven't supported him enough."

236
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,350
He added, "You aren't sufficiently loyal."

237
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
And then you replied?

238
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,070
Mark Esper: I say, you know, "That's his prerogative, to fire me."

239
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,600
But I say, "My oath is to the Constitution, not to him."
