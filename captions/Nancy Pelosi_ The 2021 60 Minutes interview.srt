1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,080
january 6 should have been a day of ceremony  when congress met in joint session then opened  

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,640
and counted electoral votes for president and vice  president instead it will be remembered as the day  

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,720
an angry mob stirred up an aim down pennsylvania  avenue by an election-losing president smashed  

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,320
its way into the capital leaving five dead the  building ransacked an american democracy under  

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,360
siege on friday we joined house speaker nancy  pelosi at the capitol where her influence in  

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,320
the nation's leadership is growing as president  trump's power support and relevance dissipates  

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,080
the story will continue in a moment

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,640
madam speaker who is running the government  of the united states we have a pandemic  

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,280
we just had this horrendous act of  violence up here we had a russian hack  

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,800
of our institutions is anybody running the  executive branch of the government who is running  

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,600
the executive sadly the person who's running  executive branch is a deranged unhinged dangerous  

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,560
president of the united states and only a  number of days until we can be protected  

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,600
from him but he has done something so serious  that there should be prosecution against him  

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,200
well i gather that the 25th amendment is off  the table that isn't nothing is off the table  

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,040
the mayhem at the capitol started early afternoon  on january 6 with the rioters barreling past the  

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,880
barricades clashing with police and breaking  into the capitol as they swarmed through  

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,000
the halls the speaker was on the house floor  during the count of the electoral college vote  

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,800
oh look so tell us what happened when when  the uh protesters were trying to get in here  

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,400
you're up there well the when the protesters  were making the assault on the capitol before  

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,440
they even got to these doors the capitol police  pulled me from the podium and i was concerned  

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
because i said no i want to be here and they  said well no you have to leave i said no i'm  

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,480
not leaving this no you must leave police guns  drawn held the invaders off the house floor but  

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
over in the senate the trump supporters  were able to break into the chamber  

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,800
the scenes were shocking to watch i think there  was universally accepted that what happened

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:09,120
was a terrible terrible violation of what of  the capital of the first branch of government  

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,120
the the legislative branch by the president of the  united states the mob was free to roam the halls  

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,560
one group making it right up to speaker pelosi's  suite of offices this door they broke down as you  

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,880
can see oh my goodness they broke that down look  at that they broke the door they smashed it and  

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:39,120
went through to another door behind which pelosi's  young staff coward terrorized the staff went under  

30
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,000
the table barricaded the door turned out the  lights and were silent in the dark under the  

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,400
table onto the table for two and a half hours wow  during which time they listened to the invaders  

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,840
banging on that door as you can hear on a  recording from one of the staffers phones

33
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,520
check this out we are inside nancy pelosi's office  across the hall a group broke into the speaker's  

34
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,360
private office oh wow oh wow you see  what they did in the mirror there the  

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,760
glass was all over the place they took uh  they smelled computer and all that stuff  

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,240
but uh laptop and then the the desk that  they actually were at was right there that  

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,960
they defamed in that way but feet on the desk  and all that that man was arrested on friday  

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,640
and the fbi is investigating whether any of the  agitators some seen in ballistic vests with zip  

39
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:52,240
ties intended to kidnap or kill legislators or  their staffers they were coming to find you maybe  

40
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,600
to hurt you i don't know the evidence is now that  that it was a well-planned organized group with  

41
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,640
leadership and guidance and direction and the  direction was to go get people they were vocally  

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,800
saying where's the speaker we know she has staff  they're here someplace we're going to find them

43
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,280
while all this was going on speaker pelosi and  senator schumer from an undisclosed location  

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,480
called on the president to tell his followers  to leave the capitol it was a landslide election  

45
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,840
and everyone knows it especially the other side  but you have to go home now we have to have peace  

46
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
president said go home but the election  was you know you know went on with his  

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,560
lies his misrepresentations his delusion  that he won a landslide in this election  

48
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,840
so finally the protesters were ejected and  you came almost right back into session  

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,320
how did that happen i know from chuck schumer and  from mitch mcconnell there was consensus that we  

50
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,520
should come there there were some suggestions  that it may take too long and we should do it  

51
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,200
at the undisclosed location but there was general  beliefs that it from the message of strength that  

52
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,440
we needed to send we had to go back to the capitol  as soon as possible the senate will come to order  

53
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
vice president pence who had been taken to a  secure location in the capitol concurred with the  

54
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,320
decision to resume the count amid reports that he  was livid at the president let's get back to work  

55
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,640
work dragged on until almost 4 am i object  as republicans challenge certified election  

56
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,400
results and they did that after the violence  after the violence shame on them and shame won  

57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,400
two-thirds of the republican caucus in the house  supporting those so these people are enablers  

58
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,000
of the president's behavior i remember when  republicans in the senate went to see richard  

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,640
nixon and said it's over that's what has to  happen now one of the reasons she's so eager  

60
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,360
to see mr trump's immediate removal from office  is her grave concern that in the next 10 days  

61
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,920
he might try to do something reckless militarily  including ordering the use of nuclear weapons  

62
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,400
she told us she sought advice from general mark  milley chairman of the joint chiefs i have sought  

63
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
information from those who are in a position  to know that there are protections against  

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,640
this dangerous president initiating any military  hostilities or something worse than that something  

65
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,480
else she and senator schumer did was call  the vice president to urge him to initiate  

66
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,320
the 25th amendment that provides procedures  to remove a president from office we were  

67
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,400
kept on the line for 20 minutes he was going  to be here in a minute a minute a minute well  

68
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,640
he never did it kept you on hold for 20 minutes  at least of course i was i was at home so i was  

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
running the dishwasher putting my clothes in  the laundry we're still waiting for him to  

70
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,480
return the call joseph r biden jr of the  state of delaware has received 306 votes  

71
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,000
donald j trump of the state of florida has  received 232 votes after congress confirmed  

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,320
joe biden's victory in the election president  trump read from a teleprompter offering his most  

73
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,960
conciliatory statement about the election a new  administration will be inaugurated on january 20th  

74
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,600
my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth orderly  and seamless transition of power mr trump has  

75
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,400
said he will not attend the inauguration the  new president has said he wants to turn over  

76
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:50,320
a new page of bipartisan cooperation in  the election in november uh someone said  

77
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:00,000
that the uh the mandate that the democrats won was  not about issues because you lost so many seats  

78
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:10,080
that the mandate was for tone and attitude and  a strong desire for compromise i do know that it  

79
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,280
was a mandate for us to go forward with an agenda  for america's working families as well as to do  

80
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,440
so in tone we have i always say to our members  we have a responsibility to find common ground

81
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,320
when we can't we must stand our ground but we have  to we have a responsibility to try you yourself  

82
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,000
are not known as a person who compromises no  i am uncompromised we want to get the job done  

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,160
i'm i'm mischaracterized by the republicans  that way but that's a tactic that they use  

84
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
now we don't know we want results for the  american people what about the covert relief  

85
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,480
package yeah that was held up for eight  months no but that was their obstruction  

86
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,800
i understand this oh wait was there obstruction  yours their obstruction no yours too it was  

87
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,920
you held out for eight months no no we held it up  because there was no no respect for our heroes our  

88
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,280
state and local healthcare workers police and fire  our first responders our sanitation transportation  

89
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,720
food workers our teachers our teachers our  teachers they would not go down that path there's  

90
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,880
a member of your caucus who said specifically that  we look like obstructionists and it was a mistake  

91
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,360
but i don't remember anybody saying that and they  may have and they may have but it isn't it wasn't  

92
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,960
a mistake and i would not and nobody expects me  to to support something that solidifies injustice  

93
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,960
in our country let's talk about the russian hack  there was an invasion a cyber invasion big deal  

94
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,000
big deal what should the united states do about  that in terms of the hack that the president  

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,120
would not assert his authority first of all he  hasn't said anything no he hasn't said anything  

96
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,160
except that maybe china did it yeah what the the  president again has a ten-year blind spot and  

97
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,440
whatever obligation i don't know what the russians  have on president trump whether it's personal  

98
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
whether it's political whether it's financial  i don't know what it is you think they have  

99
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,120
something on them but there's no other explaining  why this president united states is such a  

100
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:39,440
handmaiden of putin can we talk about the a word  what's that age oh age you're 80 right you're  

101
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:48,880
number two steny hoyer is 81 your number three jim  clyburn is 80. uh why haven't you brought young  

102
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,040
people into the leadership because we have you  perhaps don't know why does aoc complain that  

103
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,360
you have not been grooming younger people for  leadership i don't know you'll have to ask her  

104
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,960
because we are that was kind of sharp kind of  dismissing her i'm not dismissing her i respect  

105
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,800
her i think she's very effective as are other or  many other members in our caucus that the press  

106
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,680
doesn't pay attention to but they are there and  they are building support for what comes next the  

107
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,760
speaker intends to keep the pressure on president  trump to leave office as soon as possible  

108
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,480
if he does not resign immediately she has  threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings  

109
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,160
what if he pardons himself what if he pardons  these people who are terrorists on the capitol or  

110
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,920
part of he does that he can only pardon himself  from federal offenses he cannot pardon himself  

111
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,040
from state offenses and that's where he's  being investigated in the state of new york  

112
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,440
there is a possibility that after all of  this there's no punishment no consequence  

113
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,960
and he could run again for president and that's  one of the motivations that people have for  

114
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,160
advocating for impeachment won't that take more  than the ten days i mean does it actually make  

115
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,680
sense well i like the 25th amendment because it  gets rid of him he's out of office but there is  

116
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,400
strong support in the congress for  impeaching the president a second time  

117
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:29,600
this president is guilty of inciting insurrection  insurrection he has to pay a price for that
