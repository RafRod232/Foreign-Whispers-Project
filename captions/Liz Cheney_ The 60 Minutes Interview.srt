1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,560
this past week the house elect committee  investigating the january 6th attack on  

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
the capital shifted into a higher  gear on thursday it subpoenaed four  

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,480
of former president donald trump's top advisers  including his chief of staff for documents and  

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,640
depositions about the former president's actions  on the day of the siege and days leading up to it  

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,200
at the center of the select committee's probe  is wyoming representative liz chaney like  

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,280
a lone ranger riding out of the west she's  one of the few republicans willing to daring  

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,320
to stand up to mr trump and house republican  leaders who opposed her joining the committee  

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
when we spoke to congresswoman  cheney at the capitol on wednesday  

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:57,840
we asked about a call she got from house speaker  nancy pelosi the story will continue in a moment

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:08,320
she called me and asked me to be a member of the  committee and i accepted right away right away no  

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,080
hesitation none because it's so important and and  because i also know that that my participation in  

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,800
the committee makes that committee bipartisan  no one will question you know my conservative  

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,880
credentials but most republicans in the house  see what you're doing as a betrayal they look  

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,600
at nancy pelosi even you have said you said this  i've got a quote here you said the democrats  

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,320
under nancy pelosi's leadership have become the  party of anti-semitism infanticide and socialism  

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,760
direct quote from you and yet here you are it's  considered nancy pelosi's committee look i i think  

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,440
that millions of people around the country have  been betrayed and misled and deceived by donald  

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,800
trump he has said that the election was stolen he  continues to say that he continues to say things  

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,000
that aren't true and continues to raise money  off of those claims and so to me there's just  

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,640
not a question she's one of only two republicans  on the nine-member committee and a prominent face  

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,160
of it since she was elevated to vice chair we must  also know what happened every minute of that day  

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,280
in the white house republicans in congress  feel that by joining this january 6 panel  

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,440
you are helping to keep the focus on trump instead  of on the shortcomings of the biden administration  

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,240
those who think that by ignoring trump

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:54,240
he will go away have been proven wrong and in  my view the american people they deserve better  

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,080
than having to choose between what i think are the  really disastrous policies of joe biden in a whole  

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,960
range of areas really bad for our economy from a  national security perspective what's happened what  

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,640
he's done in afghanistan very dangerous policies  for the country but the alternative cannot be  

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,880
a man who doesn't believe in the rule of law and  who violated his oath of office her unabashed  

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,120
defiance of donald trump has him fighting back the  liz cheney's of the world we got to get rid of him  

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,160
he singled her out at his rally on january  6th and later said she's a warmongering fool  

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,280
and a horrible human being he's made defeating  her next year in her re-election in wyoming one  

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,920
of his top priorities she's risking her political  career most republicans we've spoken to feel that  

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,320
uh you miscalculated that you didn't figure  out ahead of time that it was going to be  

35
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,480
this intense this hot this perpetual you know it  wasn't a calculation you didn't weigh and measure  

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,040
no there wasn't a yellow pad with the pros and the  cons and no it was this is what what he has done  

37
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,840
i watched while the attack was underway understood  very clearly what he did on january 6th what he  

38
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,800
failed to do on january 6th instead of stopping  the attack while it was underway he was busy  

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,960
calling up senators trying to get them to delay  the count so there was no calculation i think he's  

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:37,040
very dangerous here in wyoming liz chaney at 55 is  having to fight like hell to win her fourth term  

41
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,520
as mr trump endorsed one of her opponents  harriet hageman a longtime cheney supporter  

42
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,160
and family friend the republican party here has  disowned you they've called for your resignation  

43
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,640
we've been told your approval rating here is  down around 30 percent can you win this seat  

44
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,840
absolutely i think it's going to be the most  important house race in the country uh in 2022  

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,640
and and it will be one where people do  have the opportunity to say we want to  

46
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,320
stand for the constitution do you think a vote  against you is a vote against the constitution  

47
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,600
a vote against me in this race a vote  for whomever donald trump has endorsed  

48
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,280
is a vote for somebody who's  willing to perpetuate the big lie  

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,240
somebody who's willing to put allegiance to trump  above allegiance to the constitution absolutely

50
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
being in trouble in wyoming is  almost unfathomable for a cheney  

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
help to ensure that the voice of wyoming is heard  in washington despite criticism of her father dick  

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,080
cheney's tenure as vice president when he pressed  the case for the broadly discredited war in iraq  

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,720
and harsh interrogation techniques he's been long  admired here having been wyoming's congressman for  

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,400
10 years did you go to your father and ask  for his advice on this and did he encourage  

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,440
you to wage this rebellion well i talk to my dad  probably just about every single day and he sees  

56
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,960
things the way that i see them she was exposed  to the highest levels of power in washington  

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,320
when her father was president ford's chief of  staff but she says her roots are in wyoming  

58
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,040
where the cowboy ethic of the maverick  loner runs deep she's been called steely  

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,880
and as emotional as algebra but she softens up  when she talks about her family i miss these years  

60
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,840
they're little babies most people don't know that  she's been married for 29 years and is the mother  

61
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:55,920
of five children ranging in age from 15 to 27. as  they grew up she became a rodeo mom one is a rodeo  

62
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,120
barrel gracie is that's right she gave me the  phrase cowgirl up which is you know if things  

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,040
are things are rough you got a cowgirl up and  keep going she's having to cowgirl up a lot in  

64
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,040
washington in may her fellow republicans stripped  her of her leadership position in the house  

65
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:22,160
and she began denouncing minority leader kevin  mccarthy in scathing and personal terms what he's  

66
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,880
done is embrace donald trump and if i were doing  what he's doing i i would be deeply ashamed of  

67
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,200
myself i don't know how you explain that to your  children when you are in a situation where you  

68
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,800
have somebody who did what donald trump did it is  absolutely clear he cannot continue to be somebody  

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
you embrace but are you saying you can't support  anybody who supports him i'm saying that there are  

70
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,600
people who supported donald trump because of  his policies but there's a difference between  

71
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,240
somebody who voted for donald trump and being  the republican leader after an insurrection and  

72
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,520
setting all of that aside and going to mar-a-lago  and and rehabilitating him bringing him back in  

73
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,680
that to me is unforgivable once she began  assailing donald trump and republicans who  

74
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,000
support him a record amount of money has poured  into her campaign some of it we're told from  

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
democrats you have become in a way a hero to the  liberals which is kind of funny because as you say  

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,520
yourself you're one of the most conservative  members of the house you're anti-abortion i'm  

77
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,920
pro-life yes you're pro-life yes your pro-gun  rights and you voted to repeal obamacare do you  

78
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:47,440
regret that vote i do not no waterboarding aka  torture well it's not torture but you support  

79
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,520
waterboarding i do absolutely and then there's her  long-held opposition to same-sex marriage which  

80
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,080
prompted a bitter falling out with her sister mary  your sister's gay she's married she has children  

81
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,680
and in 2013 you came out against same-sex  marriage while your father went the other way  

82
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,040
and it was looked upon as courageous when he did  that how do you defend what you did i was wrong

83
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,640
i was wrong i love my sister very much  uh i love uh her family very much and  

84
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,840
and i was wrong it's a it's a very personal  issue and very personal for my family  

85
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,760
i believe that my dad was right and my  sister and i have had that conversation  

86
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,120
wow i was not expecting that you  know this this is an issue that  

87
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,320
we have to recognize you know as as human beings  that we need to work against discrimination  

88
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,240
of all kinds in our country in our state we were  at an event a few nights ago and and uh there was  

89
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,600
a young woman who said she doesn't feel safe  uh sometimes uh because she's transgender and  

90
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,520
nobody should feel unsafe freedom means freedom  for everybody okay so then we'll do those her  

91
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,560
change of heart is a rare break for her from  traditional party orthodoxy once donald trump  

92
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,200
became the republican nominee for president in  2016 she supported him you stuck with him through  

93
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,000
the hollywood access tape through his insults  on john mccain through his bullying tweets i  

94
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,840
supported donald trump's policies i voted with  him something like 93 percent of the time because  

95
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:54,080
his policies uh were were the right ones in many  ways when i disagreed with him i spoke out but  

96
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,840
not on not on character on the issues  that mattered for wyoming i stood with him  

97
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,240
you know you can say you disagree with him you  think that his character was bad which it was  

98
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,560
all of those things but the line that can't  be crossed is what happened after the election  

99
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,880
it's not that liz cheney doesn't have any  republican support former president george w  

100
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,120
bush is holding a fundraiser for her and senators  mitch mcconnell and lindsey graham have sent in  

101
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,600
donations from their political action committees  but most republicans in office have shied away  

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,760
have members of congress republicans come  up to you privately and whispered in your  

103
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:46,960
ear way to go liz and encouraged you but won't  come forward and say that publicly yes a lot  

104
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,040
yes both in the house and the senate i mean if  they really think what you're doing is right  

105
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,800
and they admire it and they encourage it and  they won't do it what is that the argument that  

106
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,840
that you often hear is that if you do something  that's perceived as against trump that you know  

107
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,840
you'll put yourself in political peril and that's  a self-fulfilling prophecy because if republican  

108
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,720
leaders don't stand up and condemn what happened  then the voices in the party that are so dangerous  

109
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,840
will only get louder and stronger polls say that  78 of republicans do not think that joe biden was  

110
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,880
legitimately elected and i wonder how do  you fight an untruth how do you stand up  

111
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,880
to the anti-vaxxers how do you stand up to q  anon how do you stand up to a president who says  

112
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,840
the election and falsely that the election was  rigged when you look at the the spread of these  

113
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:57,280
mistruths and the spread of the disinformation you  know silence enables it silence enables the liar  

114
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,680
and silence helps it to spread so the first thing  you have to do is say no i'm not going to accept  

115
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,160
that we're going to live in a post-truth world  it's a toxin leslie in in our in our political  

116
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:20,000
bloodstream because when we allow that to continue  to go on in the face of rulings of the courts  

117
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,080
in the face of recounts in the face of everything  that's gone on to demonstrate that there was not  

118
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,240
fraud that would have changed the outcome then  we all if we do that we are contributing to the  

119
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:42,720
undermining of our system and it's a really  serious and dangerous moment because of that
