1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,520
bill gates helped usher in the digital  revolution at microsoft and has spent the  

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,600
decade since exploring and investing in innovative  solutions to some of the world's toughest problems  

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,960
global poverty disease and the coronavirus  pandemic which he spent nearly two billion dollars  

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,560
on now he's focusing on climate change agreeing  with the overwhelming majority of scientists  

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,400
who warn of a looming climate disaster the good  news is gates believes it's possible to prevent  

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,480
a catastrophic rise in temperatures the bad news  he says in the next 30 years we need scientific  

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,720
breakthroughs technological innovations and global  cooperation on a scale the world has never seen  

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
the story will continue in a moment

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,800
you believe this is the toughest challenge  humanity has ever faced absolutely the amount of  

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,480
change uh new ideas it's way greater than the  pandemic and it needs a level of cooperation  

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,400
that would be unprecedented that doesn't  sound no it's not easy uh but hey 30 years  

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,880
we have more educated people than ever we have  a generation that's speaking out on this topic  

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,440
uh and you know i got to participate in the  miracle of the personal computer and the  

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,240
internet and so yes i have a bias to believe  innovation can do these things he's talking  

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,360
about innovations in every aspect of modern  life manufacturing agriculture transportation  

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,800
because nearly everything we now do releases  earth-warming greenhouse gases mainly carbon  

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,560
dioxide into the atmosphere he took us to his  favorite burger joint in seattle to explain  

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,200
you're talking about changing everything in the  economy i mean every aspect yeah the physical of  

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,040
what we can see right now of us sitting around  here what specifically would be impacted well  

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,480
this cement uh would be made in a different way  the steel in the building would be different  

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,280
you know the meat and the burger is a big  deal these you know all this plastic and paper  

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,640
potatoes with potatoes you're talking about  fertilizer the irrigation system that's used  

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
all the tractors the transport trucks  that bring them to this restaurant  

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,520
all that has to change hey when you're going to  zero it you don't get to skip anything gates says  

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,840
going to zero means eliminating all greenhouse gas  emissions or else if they wait a hundred years to  

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,520
do this it's way too late uh then the natural  ecosystems will have failed the instability uh  

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,480
you know the migration you know those things will  will get really really bad well before the end of  

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,320
the century when you talk about migration you're  talking about hundreds of thousands of people  

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,280
trying to move from north africa to europe every  year exactly the syrian war was a 20th of what  

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,640
climate migration will look like so the deaths per  year are way 10 times greater than than what we've  

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,560
experienced in the pandemic in a new book how to  avoid a climate disaster gates outlines all the  

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,640
solutions he believes we need he says the u.s has  to lead the world getting to zero greenhouse gas  

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,280
emissions by 2050. he supports president biden's  decision to rejoin the paris climate agreement but  

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,640
is asking the administration to massively increase  the budget for climate and clean energy research  

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,560
to 35 billion dollars a year you've said  that governments need to do the hard stuff  

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,320
but not just go after the low-hanging  fruit what's low-hanging fruit  

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,280
passenger cars part of the electric generation  with renewables the things everybody knows about  

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,520
that's getting almost all the money not the hard  parts which is the industrial piece including the  

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,480
steel and cement those pieces we've hardly started  to work on no one thinks much about cement and  

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,960
steel but making it accounts for 16 percent of all  carbon dioxide emissions and the demand is only  

41
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,880
growing the world will add an estimated two and  a half trillion square feet of buildings by 2060  

42
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,920
that's the equivalent to putting up another new  york city every month for the next 40 years so one  

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,600
innovative company gates has been pouring money  into is carbon cure they inject captured carbon  

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,280
dioxide into concrete what they do is they stick  co2 in here and the cement and they mix them up  

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,320
and so you're able to actually get rid  of some co2 by sticking it in the cement  

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,640
right now they get rid of about five percent but  they have a next generation they can get to 30  

47
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,360
percent the carbon has been just injected into  this so it's captured it so it's not going to be  

48
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,160
released into the atmosphere that's right gates  has already invested two billion dollars of his  

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,880
own money on new green technologies and plans  to spend several billion more in 2016 he also  

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,720
recruited jeff bezos mike bloomberg and nearly two  dozen other wealthy investors to back a billion  

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,800
dollar fund called breakthrough energy ventures  making long-term often risky investments in  

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,360
promising technologies it kind of blows my mind  you know what's the cost of making that stuff  

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,400
gates regularly consults with the fund's team  of top scientists and entrepreneurs who've so  

54
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,040
far invested in 50 companies with cutting-edge  ideas to reduce carbon emissions what's like  

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,920
the most far-flung idea you've backed there's  one that's so crazy it's even hard to describe

56
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,560
it's so crazy it's hard to describe even yeah  how do you pitch that to investors they find  

57
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,640
geological formations and they just pump water  down into them the energy they've used uh to  

58
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,160
pump it in then they can draw that energy back  out so it's it's a water pressure storage thing  

59
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,240
which you know when i first thought i thought  that can't work but but you gave money to it  

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,320
yeah lots of money because cows account for  around four percent of all greenhouse gases gates  

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,560
has invested in two companies making plant-based  meat substitutes impossible foods and beyond meat  

62
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,320
but farming the vegetables used to make  many meat alternatives emits gases as well  

63
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,200
so gates is also backing a company that's  created an entirely new food source  

64
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,720
this company nature's find is using fungi  and then they turn them into sausage and  

65
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,200
yogurt pretty amazing when you say fungi do you  mean like a mushroom or a microbe it's a microbe  

66
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,320
the microbe was discovered in the ground in  a geyser in yellowstone national park without  

67
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,680
soil or fertilizer it can be grown to produce  this nutritional protein that can then be turned  

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,440
into a variety of foods with a small carbon  footprint this is the yogurt oh this is good  

69
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,480
wow i've had like cashew yogurt or oat yogurt it's  sort of along those lines yeah with the burgers  

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,920
they're you know like beyond impossible they're  getting close to real thing but you can still tell  

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,320
these i'm not sure i could tell no i'm more  of a burger expert than i am a yogurt gates  

72
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,600
never planned to focus on climate change but while  working in africa with the foundation he started  

73
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,600
with his wife melinda in 2000 he came to see just  how vulnerable those in developing countries are  

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,920
to the effects of rising temperatures so 15 years  ago gates started educating himself on climate  

75
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,120
change bringing scientists and engineers to his  office in seattle for what he calls learning  

76
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,520
sessions he also reads voraciously books and  binders full of scientific research yeah so  

77
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,040
this is the most recent one which is about clean  hydrogen so you're reading thousands of pages  

78
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,240
every few days on topics yeah my reading is is  key and then asking questions when it it doesn't  

79
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,880
make sense gates isn't just looking to cut future  carbon emissions he's also investing in direct air  

80
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,600
capture an experimental process to remove existing  co2 from the atmosphere some companies are now  

81
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,080
using these giant fans to capture co2 directly  out of the air gates has become one of the world's  

82
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,920
largest funders of this kind of technology but of  all his green investments gates has spent the most  

83
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,320
time and money pursuing a breakthrough in nuclear  energy arguing it's key to a zero-carbon future  

84
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,080
he says he's a big believer in wind and solar and  thinks it can one day provide up to 80 percent of  

85
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,520
the country's electricity but gates insists  unless we discover an effective way to store  

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,000
and ship wind and solar energy nuclear power will  likely have to do the rest energy from nuclear  

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,280
plants can be stored so it's available when the  sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing  

88
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,720
were you always a big proponent of nuclear  in 2008 he founded terrapower a company that  

89
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,320
has redesigned a nuclear reactor this is your  prototype exactly terrapower's naturing reactor  

90
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,680
uh this is a rendering we haven't built it  yet but here's the nuclear island right here  

91
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,040
this is the reactor exactly gate says  terrapower's reactor is less expensive to build  

92
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,040
produces less waste and is fully automated  reducing the potential for human error gates  

93
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,760
and director of engineering lindsey boles showed  us what they say is another key to its safety  

94
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,240
what is it that we're looking at here so these  individual fuel pins are actually where the  

95
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,840
uranium fuel is and that's what generates all the  heat in our natrium reactor this is what everybody  

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,480
is worried about yes exactly in a normal reactor  it's water that's flowing past and heating up  

97
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,680
and it'll boil and generate a lot of high pressure  that high heat and pressure can cause an explosion  

98
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,320
like in chernobyl in 1986 when radioactive  material was spread for thousands of miles but  

99
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,160
gates says the pteropower reactor won't use water  to cool down the fuel rods they plan to use liquid  

100
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,200
sodium the liquid sodium can absorb a lot more  heat and so we we don't have any high pressure  

101
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,400
inside the reactor in october the department of  energy awarded terror power 80 million dollars to  

102
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,520
build one of the first advanced nuclear reactors  in the u.s nuclear power can be done in a way that  

103
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,480
none of those uh failures of the past would  recur because just the physics of how it's built  

104
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,880
i admit convincing people of that will be  almost as hard as actually building it but  

105
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,680
since it may be necessary to avoid climate change  we shouldn't give up you've been criticized for  

106
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
being a technocrat saying technology is the only  solution for for tackling climate change there  

107
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,320
are other people say look the solution's already  there it's just government policy is what really  

108
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,800
needs to be focused on i wish that was true i  wish all this funding of these companies wasn't  

109
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,400
necessary at all without innovation we will not  solve climate change we won't even come close  

110
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,560
gates credits young activists for keeping  climate change in the headlines but he knows some  

111
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,440
consider him an imperfect ally are you the right  messenger on this because you fly private planes  

112
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,920
a lot and you're creating a lot of greenhouse  gases yourself yeah i'd probably have one of  

113
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,160
the highest greenhouse gas footprints  of anyone on the planet you know my my  

114
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:52,720
personal flying uh alone is gigantic now i'm  spending quite a bit uh to buy aviation fuel  

115
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,120
uh that was made with plants you know i switched  to an electric car i've used solar panels  

116
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,160
i'm paying a company that actually at a very high  price can pull a bit of carbon out of the air  

117
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,760
and stick it underground and so i'm offsetting  my personal emissions those are called carbon  

118
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,320
offsets right so you know it's costing like 400 a  ton it's like 7 million dollars so you're paying 7  

119
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,600
million a year to offset your carbon footprint yep  he's encouraging others who can afford it to buy  

120
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,680
carbon offsets and green products so that what he  calls the green premium the added production costs  

121
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,560
for reducing carbon emissions will go down and  quality of products up driving the innovations  

122
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:47,360
that may get us to zero it just seems overwhelming  if every aspect of our daily life has to change it  

123
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,080
can seem overwhelming but you are optimistic yeah  there are days when it looks very hard if people  

124
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,760
think it's easy they're wrong if people think  it's impossible they're wrong it's possible it's  

125
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,440
possible but it'll be the most amazing thing  mankind has ever done that's what it has to  

126
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,080
be yeah it's an all-out effort you know like a  world war but it's us against greenhouse gases

127
