1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,560
on february 24th with the russian  invasion coming at him from three sides  

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,960
ukrainian president volodomir zielinski  reached for his most powerful weapon  

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,160
his phone the moment zelinski  told his people he refused to flee  

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,480
ukraine refused to fall leaders don't become  legends often but over these nearly seven weeks  

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,440
this 44 year old former comedian inspired his  country to stand up to the overwhelming force  

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,320
of russia last wednesday we were admitted to  zielinski's fortified war rooms to meet the  

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,640
man who stands between the russian army and the  free world the story will continue in a moment

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,840
we met president zielinski in the blacked-out  hallways of his command center in ukraine's  

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,680
capital kiev it is a fortress crowded  with troops machine guns mines explosives  

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,840
and a great deal more are you safe here yeah  i'm fine he told us i feel pretty calm about it  

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,080
our guards are worried because there could be an  air strike but when we get the air raid evacuation  

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,840
signal we head downstairs mr president what  has it been like working under these conditions

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,480
we we we found way how to work  

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
we don't have any another way you found a  way how to work you don't have any other ways

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,520
slipping back into ukrainian he said it has to  be dark in here you can't switch the lights on  

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,400
because a bomb could just fly in during an  airstrike you have you have troops sleeping  

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:59,520
the president and his staff have lived here for  46 days now russian invasion plan expected kiev  

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,960
to fall in three days but that relied on  one assumption that zielinski would run no

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,680
before i do something i analyze the situation  i've always done it calmly without any chaos  

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,920
i might not be the strongest warrior  but i'm not willing to betray anyone  

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,240
what did you tell your wife and  children about your decision

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,240
i told them this is my choice and i can't do it  any other way i'm the president of my country  

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,160
i'm the president of our people and even if  i wasn't president i would have stayed here  

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,480
my family understood not only understood  but fully supported my decision fully  

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,840
it was the decision that saved ukraine from  immediate collapse good evening everyone he said  

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,240
we are all here our soldiers are here  the citizens of the country are here  

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,840
we are all here protecting our independence  our country and we're going to continue  

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
you had made a decision to give your  life for your country if it came to that  

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,960
i don't want to make myself out to be  a hero he said i love my family i want  

30
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,720
to live many more years but choosing  between running or being with my people  

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,760
of course i'm ready to give my life for my  country you just want to work for a man with  

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,080
44 million lives in his hands we found zielinski  buoyant gracious humble and brutally honest

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,040
the day before our visit and angrier zielinski  

34
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
scolded the u.n security council  where's the security he asked

35
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,200
in speaking to nato you called them weak  

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
in speaking to the u.n security  council you said if you can't help  

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:25,360
you shouldn't exist not very diplomatic of you i  wonder why you feel the need to speak so bluntly

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,240
when you're working at diplomacy there are no  results all of this is very bureaucratic that's  

39
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,480
why the way i am talking to them is absolutely  justifiable i don't have any more lives to give  

40
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,120
i don't have any more emotions i'm no longer  interested in their diplomacy that leads to  

41
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,080
the destruction of my country a lot of countries  have changed their mind about ukraine and about  

42
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,440
our people but i think we've paid too high a  price for that what must the world understand

43
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,280
we are defending the ability of a person to  live in the modern world we are defending  

44
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,040
the right to live bravo i never thought this  right was so costly these are human values  

45
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,880
so that russia doesn't choose what we  should do and how i'm exercising my rights  

46
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,920
that right was given to me by god and my parents

47
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,680
god was hard to find on our  visit to keeve's northern suburbs  

48
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,600
which russia occupied for weeks much of  what we found will be difficult to watch  

49
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,160
behind saint andrews church there is a sandy  trench not quite full of civilian residents of the  

50
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,000
town of bucha ukraine stopped the russians here  45 minutes from the center of the capital city  

51
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,720
the russian retreat was so hasty it seems there  was no time to cover up the war crimes president  

52
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:22,240
zielinski visited bucha two days before our  interview what did you see in bucha smart death  

53
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,000
just death last monday was the first  time zielinski saw with his own eyes  

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,080
what russia has done in what vladimir  putin calls the liberation of ukraine

55
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:49,040
the day after our interview we found civilian  neighborhoods in bucha blocks and blocks shelled  

56
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:58,240
and blasted with no purpose but terror bodies  and parts of bodies lay in the streets left out  

57
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,480
like trash zielinski told us no one knows how many  victims are still in their homes yet to be found  

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
there's a photograph mr president of you in bucha  

59
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,800
with an expression on your face that you have  not allowed your people to see during this war  

60
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,120
and i wonder what we're seeing there is that  heartbreak is it anger this is least it's anger

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,840
it's anger

62
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,560
because we don't understand  the russians you can't really  

63
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,840
understand this world that there are  people on this planet who give these orders

64
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,000
neighborhood relief for  the hungry and the homeless  

65
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,760
looked like world war ii in color valerie  met vienko was so angry about the senseless  

66
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,360
russian bullet wound in his leg we  can't repeat what he told us in english

67
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,360
some of the russians were normal some of them  were totally crazy you could walk and they  

68
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,880
would shoot sometimes up in the air sometimes at  your legs so you'd have to jump in front of them  

69
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,160
cars were run over by russian tanks very brutal

70
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:39,840
who compressed the occupation  into a single word horror

71
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,880
she said gunfire was nonstop day and night thanks  to god it all passed and we survived it's simply a  

72
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,760
miracle i had two grandchildren with me in the  basement i never thought i would live to see  

73
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,800
this horror mr zielinski told us that he  couldn't believe that human beings could do  

74
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,360
something like this we never believed it  either we are simply in shock all of us  

75
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
what evidence is there of  war crimes across ukraine

76
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
the ukrainian security service has  intercepted communications he told us  

77
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,960
there are russian soldiers talking with  their parents about what they stole and  

78
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,640
who they abducted there are recordings of  russian prisoners of war who admitted to  

79
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,320
killing people there are pilots in prison  who had maps with civilian targets to bomb  

80
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,080
there are also investigations being done based on  the remains of the dead should vladimir putin be  

81
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,520
prosecuted for war crimes they would say look i  i think everyone who made a decision who issued  

82
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,120
an order who fulfilled an order everyone who is  relevant to this i believe they are all guilty  

83
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,080
do you hold putin responsible i do believe  he's one of them that's what i believe

84
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,960
the slaughter of civilians could have been stopped  zielinski told us he's deeply grateful for the  

85
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,360
weapons nato and the u.s are sending around the  clock but he's bitterly disappointed the allies  

86
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,480
refused to impose a no-fly zone over ukraine  president biden has called that an invitation to  

87
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:45,920
world war three but in zielinski's view it's the  kind of inaction the world has suffered before mr  

88
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:55,760
president in a speech to nato you said quote all  the people who die will die because of you because  

89
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,200
of your weakness are you saying that the west  bears some responsibility for these atrocities  

90
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,120
he told us i remember all of us remember  books about the second world war and about  

91
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,880
the devil in uniform adolf hitler are those  countries who did not participate in the war  

92
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,120
responsible the countries who let german  forces march throughout europe does the world  

93
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:33,360
carry responsibility for the genocide yes yes it  does when you have the ability to close the sky

94
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,640
yes it's scary that a world war could  start it's scary i understand that  

95
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,440
and i cannot put pressure on these  people because everyone is afraid  

96
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:55,360
of war but whether the world is responsible  for this i believe so yes i believe so stand  

97
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,920
in front of the mirror every day and ask yourself  were you able to do something or were you  

98
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,960
unable to do something you will find the answer  in the mirror to this question and to another

99
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,120
that's what i believe perhaps zelinski reaches  for world war ii because of his homeland's history  

100
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,440
of catastrophe and because he's ukraine's first  jewish president zielinski is 44 years old holds a  

101
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,120
law degree he's married with a son and a daughter  his family is safe somewhere in ukraine in this  

102
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,120
war zielinski is the leading man in a tragedy but  he's worked his entire career to make people laugh  

103
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,520
he was ukraine's favorite comedian  whose sitcom was popular in russia too  

104
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,320
in his show called servant of the people he  played a high school history teacher whose anger  

105
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,400
at corruption in ukraine explodes into a profane

106
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,680
a rant posts the tirade and the teacher is  elected president in 2019 zielinski turned  

107
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,600
parody into power he ran on an anti-corruption  platform and won 73 percent of the vote  

108
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,040
he was 41 years old he brought long-time  friend and business partner andre your mac in  

109
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:39,440
as chief of staff he is a smart he's a strong  he's a brave and he's person who is self-made  

110
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,800
zielinski is not just the leader of our heroic  nation i think he is a leader of the free world  

111
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,480
why do you say president zielinski is the leader  of the free world now because ukraine defend not  

112
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:04,160
just ukraine we defend all democracy zielinski has  been defending ukraine since his inauguration day  

113
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,720
that green t-shirt which caught the eye of the  world was no surprise to ukrainians he keeps  

114
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,200
fatigues in his office because he often visited  the battlefront near the russian border where  

115
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,880
ukraine has been in a shooting war with russia  since 2014. that was when putin invaded part of  

116
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:33,120
ukraine called the donbas and seized ukraine's  crimea peninsula in 2014 before zielinski was  

117
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:43,120
elected a russian anti-aircraft battery in ukraine  shot down an airliner killing 298 civilians

118
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,160
in our interview zielinski told us he's been  trying to warn the world that putin will not  

119
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,400
stop at ukraine mr president it appears that  the free world has calculated that the suffering  

120
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,600
of your people is not worth even the risk of a  nuclear exchange yet i think so that's how it is  

121
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,200
some are using that politically as an excuse  by saying we can't defend ukraine because there  

122
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,320
could be a nuclear war i think that today no one  in this world can predict what russia will do  

123
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,960
if they invade further into our territory they  will definitely move closer and closer to europe  

124
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,360
they will only become stronger and less  predictable president biden says he is  

125
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,480
outraged by bucha nato leaders say they are  outraged by bucha so what should they do now

126
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,440
weapons number one they need to be very serious  about it they definitely understand what i'm  

127
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,440
talking about right now they have to supply  weapons to ukraine as if they were defending  

128
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,000
themselves and their own people they need  to understand this if they don't speed up  

129
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,920
it will be very hard for us to  hold on against this pressure  

130
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,720
the second factor is sanctions because we've  found some things in sanctions that are easy  

131
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,360
for financial experts to circumvent russia has  been circumventing them and this is absolutely  

132
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:32,160
true the western world knows it this shouldn't  be allowed this is not a movie this is real life  

133
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:42,080
stop fearing the russian federation we've shown  we are not afraid when we come back in the wake  

134
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,840
of the bucha atrocities president zielinski tells  the united states what he must have to survive

135
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,800
friday a russian missile strike hit a crowd  of refugees striving to escape eastern ukraine  

136
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,040
by train at least 50 were killed five children  ukrainian president volodimer zelinski calls it a  

137
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,440
war crime tonight zielinski is fighting a powerful  russian assault on ukraine's east and south  

138
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,560
russia has not seized its strategic objectives  so instead it's shelling defiant cities  

139
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:35,280
to ruin the one exception at least now is kiev  in a feat of arms no one expected ukraine's  

140
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:42,080
outgunned army defeated the massive russian force  that had been ordered to take the capital city  

141
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,840
the story will continue in a moment

142
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:00,240
keeves survives for the moment a capital of  mummified monuments and 19th century grace  

143
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,720
before it was a bumper-to-bumper city  with 3 million residents but now the  

144
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,000
streets are congested only by shadows air  raids are still a danger but after nearly  

145
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,920
seven weeks the siren doesn't quicken the step  like it used to have you won the battle of kiev

146
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,840
give

147
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,240
if the people of those towns were wiped out  then did we win this battle i'm not sure  

148
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,440
we've withstood and we did not give up  what is ours but whether we won i can't say

149
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,400
no one expected ukraine to fight russia to  a standstill and i wonder how did you manage

150
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,080
we united as a nation even though our people  understood that they would be outnumbered tenfold  

151
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,200
and there would be no way out just no way out  we fought for our existence and for survival

152
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,880
that's the combined heroism of everyone of the  people of the authorities of the armed forces  

153
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,160
we became a single fist

154
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,240
we saw the ukrainian punch in the town of bucha  where the remains of a russian armored column  

155
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:02,080
rested dead in the street neighbors holed up for  weeks emerged to remember what victory looks like  

156
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,920
no one seemed in a hurry to deal with the  bits of russian soldiers in the wreckage  

157
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,160
the full story of how the outmanned ukrainian army  stopped the invasion of kiev will fill history  

158
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,280
books but we already know part of it because the  russians believe that keeve would fall in a matter  

159
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,400
of days they literally did not bring enough food  or fuel for their armored columns on the other  

160
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,760
side the ukrainians have been trained for years by  the california national guard and other u.s units  

161
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,280
when the invasion happened the united  states britain and other countries  

162
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,800
flooded ukraine with lightweight shoulder-fired  anti-tank missiles how much difference have  

163
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:59,120
american arms made in this war they're helping  frankly speaking i would have wanted more i don't  

164
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,520
know if i have the right to say that but the fact  that the united states has helped a lot is true  

165
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,600
zielinski's man in charge of arming ukraine  is chief of staff andre yermack when we met  

166
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,120
he just finished a two-hour call with u.s  national security adviser jake sullivan  

167
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,080
and the chairman of the joint chiefs general mark  milley yermak asked for heavier weapons faster  

168
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:34,240
first there was artillery the second we need  the tanks we need the military jets and we need  

169
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,120
everything which give to us opportunity to close  our sky when you ask the biden administration  

170
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,760
for artillery tanks jet airplanes the  administration says what we have very deep  

171
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,320
and very detailed conversation this is american  presidents who is done for ukraine more than all  

172
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,960
other presidents but then you have the  war and we are openly said we need more  

173
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:13,280
it's not enough we need it as soon as possible  if we receive this support in time we will win  

174
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,000
a white house official tells us yermak got a yes  to his requests but filling orders takes time  

175
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,520
the ukrainians need russian-made weapons that  they already know how to use the u.s is cajoling  

176
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,840
allies to ship their russian gear now on the  promise that the u.s will replace it later  

177
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,440
america has thrown in nearly 2 billion  in military aid from the ukrainian point  

178
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,760
of view of course nothing is fast enough  russian bombardment is escalating in the east  

179
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:59,600
and south cities are being shelled to ruin  including mariupol with 450 000 residents  

180
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,840
what are you expecting now in the east and in the  south we think this will be a new wave of this war  

181
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,520
we don't know how much russian weaponry there  will be but we understand they'll be many times  

182
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:21,840
more than there is now all depends on how  fast we will be helped by the united states  

183
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,320
to be honest whether we will be able  to survive depends on this i have 100  

184
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,720
confidence in our people and in our armed forces  but unfortunately i don't have the confidence  

185
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,640
that we will be receiving everything we need  and so what are you asking of president biden  

186
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,200
to tell you the truth long ago i asked president  biden for very specific items he has the list  

187
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,400
president president biden can enter history as  the person who stood shoulder to shoulder with  

188
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:04,960
the ukrainian people who won and chose the right  to have their own country this also depends on him

189
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,200
you are frustrated with president  biden no i'm not disappointed  

190
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,920
i don't know how another president in his  place would help us i don't know it's difficult  

191
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,600
we have a good relationship i think so  at least ukraine depends on the support  

192
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
of the united states and i as the leader  of a country at war i can only be grateful

193
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,200
as for the other president at war we asked  zelinski if he would meet now face to face  

194
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,760
with vladimir putin he told us it was worth the  chance they wouldn't resolve everything zelinski  

195
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:59,840
said but they might stop the killing are you  willing to give up any part of ukraine for peace

196
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,720
we're not ready to give away our country i think  we've already given up a lot of lives so we need  

197
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:16,400
to stand firm for as long as we can but this is  life different things happen it's negotiable this  

198
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,480
issue would definitely be raised in the course  of negotiations we understand the russian side we  

199
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,640
understand one of their provisions that is always  talked about is to recognize crimea as russian  

200
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,880
territory i will definitely not recognize that  and they would really like to take the southern  

201
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,520
parts of our country i clearly understand that  questions like this will be raised in negotiations  

202
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,600
if there ever are any but we were not ready  to give up our territory from the beginning  

203
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,160
had we been willing to give up our territory there  would have been no war mr president in almost  

204
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,400
every speech to your country you say that ukraine  is going to win what does winning look like to you  

205
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:12,720
victory first of all our people would definitely  feel victory they will come back the return of  

206
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,640
refugees is blood for the body of ukraine without  them there's nothing the bombardments would end  

207
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,160
we would recover our territory there would  be no russian soldiers in our country  

208
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,840
yes i understand they will not withdraw from  crimea and will be arguing and negotiating for one  

209
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,120
territory or another in the south of our country  the donbass i know exactly what has to happen  

210
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,640
after which we can say this is victory but if you  don't mind i'm not going to talk about it just yet  

211
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,880
mr president we wish you all the luck in the world

212
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,960
i need half of it i think even half will be enough

213
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,320
has borrowed more luck than anyone expected  with the reprieve of kiev ukraine has turned  

214
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,840
mere admiration into credibility its people  are suffering grievous loss every hour  

215
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,200
but they have proven there was a moment in  kiev when they silenced the guns of russia

216
