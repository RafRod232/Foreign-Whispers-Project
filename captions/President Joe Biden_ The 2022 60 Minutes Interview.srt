1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,180
Summer was going so well for the president; the White House threw a party last week with

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,750
a concert by James Taylor.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,080
Mr. Biden's streak began in June when he signed a bipartisan gun safety law.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,890
Then, in August, over Republican objections, he signed the largest investment ever on climate

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,770
change, a minimum tax on corporations, a law to lower prescription drug prices, and student

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,869
loan forgiveness.

7
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,510
But Tuesday, as James Taylor sang "Fire and Rain," it seemed like both descended on the

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,219
president's party.

9
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:45,989
The Dow plummeted nearly 1,300 points after a dismal inflation report.

10
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,179
At the White House on Thursday, we spoke to President Biden about the economy, Ukraine,

11
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,290
those top secret documents in Donald Trump's home and whether Mr. Biden will run again.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,160
The president made news and will ignite a few controversies.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:12,930
Scott Pelley: Mr. President, as you know, last Tuesday the annual inflation rate came

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,729
in at 8.3%.

15
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,270
The stock market nosedived.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,869
People are shocked by their grocery bills.

17
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,030
What can you do better and faster?

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,439
President Joe Biden: Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective.

19
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,710
Inflation rate month to month was just-- just an inch, hardly at all,

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,960
Scott Pelley: You're not arguing that 8.3% is good news.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,929
President Joe Biden: No, I'm not saying it is good news.

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,830
But it was 8.2% or-- 8.2% before.

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,820
I mean, it's not-- you're ac-- we act-- make it sound like all of a sudden, "My god, it

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,799
went to 8.2%."

25
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,359
It's been-- Scott Pelley: It's the highest inflation rate,

26
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,359
Mr. President, in 40 years.

27
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,439
President Joe Biden: I got that.

28
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,020
But guess what we are.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,180
We're in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn't spiked.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,679
It has just barely-- it's been basically even.

31
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:02,659
And in the meantime, we created all these jobs and-- and prices-- have-- have gone up,

32
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,619
but they've come down for energy.

33
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,319
The fact is that we've created 10 million new jobs.

34
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,951
We're in-- since we came to office.

35
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:14,300
We're in a situation where the-- the unemployment rate is about 3.7%.

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,580
one of the lowest in history.

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,500
We're in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the United States in a big

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,660
way.

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,220
And look down the road, we have mas-- massive investments being made in computer chips and--

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,320
and employment.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,860
So, I-- look, this is a process.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
This is a process.

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,270
Scott Pelley: Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?

44
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,610
President Joe Biden: No.

45
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,960
I don't think so.

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,860
We hope we can have what they say, "a soft landing," a transition to a place where we

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,740
don't lose the gains that I ran to make in the first place for middle-class folks, being

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,951
able to generate good-paying jobs and-- expansion.

49
00:02:52,951 --> 00:03:01,030
And at the same time-- make sure that we-- we are-- are able to continue to grow.

50
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,920
Scott Pelley: And you would tell the American people that inflation is going to continue

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
to decline?

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,200
President Joe Biden: No, I'm telling the American people that we're gonna get control of inflation.

53
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,770
And their prescription drug prices are gonna be a hell of a lotta lower.

54
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,560
Their health care costs are gonna be a lot lower.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,350
Their basic costs for everybody, their energy prices are gonna be lower.

56
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,060
They're gonna be in a situation where they begin to gain control again.

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm-- more optimistic than I've been in a long time.

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,520
Scott Pelley: Sir, with the Federal Reserve rapidly raising interest rates, what can you

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,480
do to prevent a recession?

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,000
President Joe Biden: Continue to grow the economy.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,660
And we're growing the economy.

62
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,960
It's growing in-- in a way that it hasn't in years and years.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Scott Pelley: How so?

64
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,920
President Joe Biden: We're growing entire new industries.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,540
Six hundred and ninety-five, I think it is, or eighty-five thousand new manufacturing

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,820
jobs just since I've become president in United States.

67
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,450
Continue to grow the economy and continue to give hard-working people a break in terms

68
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,760
of we pay the highest drug prices in the world of any industrialized nation.

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,130
Making sure that Medicare can negotiate down those prices by the way, we've also reduced

70
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,870
the debt and reduced the deficit by $350 billion my first year.

71
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,730
This year, it's gonna be over $1.5 trillion reduced the debt.

72
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:25,070
So, to continue to put people in a position to be able to make a decent living and grow,

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,150
and grow, and increase their capacity to grow.

74
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,590
To see what he means, we went with Mr. Biden to the Detroit Auto Show last Wednesday.

75
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,060
He celebrated his new funding of a network of charging stations for electric vehicles.

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,280
But the newly crowded convention center brought a different question to mind.

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,780
Scott Pelley: Mr. President, first Detroit Auto Show in three years.

78
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,970
Is the pandemic over?

79
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,430
President Joe Biden: The pandemic is over.

80
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,850
We still have a problem with COVID.

81
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,830
We're still doing a lotta work on it.

82
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,430
It's-- but the pandemic is over.

83
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,340
if you notice, no one's wearing masks.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,430
Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,940
And so I think it's changing.

86
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,040
And I think this is a perfect example of it.

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,470
The car show was a reminder that gasoline prices hit a historic high last June—in

88
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,200
part because Russia cut fuel supplies in its war on Ukraine.

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,170
Scott Pelley: Mr. President, the price of gasoline is down about 26% from the $5 high.

90
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,690
What can you do to keep that price down while Vladimir Putin is throttling energy supplies?

91
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,510
President Joe Biden: Well, there's-- there's a couple things we've done.

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,800
For example, remember I got some criticism for releasing a million barrels of oil a day

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,010
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

94
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,760
And then along came the industry saying they'd produce another million barrels a day by the

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
spring.

96
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
So, I think we're in relatively good shape.

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,710
Scott Pelley: Vladimir Putin is going to try to break your will on Ukraine and use energy

98
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,710
prices to do it.

99
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,120
President Joe Biden: Sure he is.

100
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,980
But, you know, we, the United States, are in much better shape than-- than anyone else

101
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,870
is, and relative to Russia particularly.

102
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,000
But-- he's been trying that for a while.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,620
He's not gonna succeed.

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:20,460
But at this very moment that Mr. Biden steered for the future, a 19th century form of transport

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,870
threatened to wreck the economy.

106
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,090
A deadline for a national rail strike was two days away.

107
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,850
The White House brokered a deal, Thursday, after a 20-hour marathon of negotiations.

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,770
President Joe Biden: One of the things that happens in negotiations, particularly if they've

109
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,639
been elongated like these have, is people say and do things where they-- the pride gets

110
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,980
engaged as well.

111
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,890
And it's awful hard to back off of some of these things.

112
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,371
They both sat down, in my view-- and they were in the office today saying, "Well, we

113
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,930
finally figured it out.

114
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,199
This is fair on both sides."

115
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,740
And it took that time to focus.

116
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,660
And-- and the alternative was just not thinkable.

117
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,790
Scott Pelley: What do you mean?

118
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,590
President Joe Biden: If, in fact, they'd gone on a strike, the supply chains in this country

119
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,620
would've come to a screeching halt.

120
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,270
We would've seen a real economic crisis.

121
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,450
The other crisis on the president's desk, Ukraine, was also improving last week as Ukrainian

122
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,669
forces recaptured about 3,000 square miles from the Russian invasion.

123
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,150
Scott Pelley: Is Ukraine winning the war?

124
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,910
President Joe Biden: Ukraine, through their-- the significant help we and our allies are

125
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:38,699
giving them and the incredible bravery and the incredible determination of the Ukrainian

126
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,650
people, are not losing a war, and they're making gains in certain areas.

127
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,620
Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely and recognizing

128
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,640
the sovereignty.

129
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,790
they're defeating Russia.

130
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,592
Russia's turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were

131
00:07:58,592 --> 00:07:59,950
gonna be.

132
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,090
But winning the war?

133
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,590
the damage it's doing, and the-- and the citizens, and the innocent people are being killed,

134
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,560
it's awful hard to count that as winning.

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,550
After the horrors of seven months of war, President Biden has called Russian President

136
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,860
Vladimir Putin a war criminal.

137
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,530
President Joe Biden: It has been barbaric, what he's done.

138
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:29,199
His attacks on civilian-- everything from civilian hospitals to-- to, you know, people--

139
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,440
old-age homes, to neighborhoods where just ordinary people live--

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Scott Pelley: Schools.

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,469
President Joe Biden: --to schools, it's-- it's just outrageous.

142
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:45,459
And-- so the-- the price Ukrainian people are paying for this war is extremely high.

143
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,199
But we're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help.

144
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,100
Scott Pelley: You're already north of $15 billion in terms of those commitments.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
How far do you go?

146
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,389
President Joe Biden: As long as it takes.

147
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:56,069
Scott Pelley: Ironclad commitment?

148
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,749
President Joe Biden: Yes.

149
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:04,519
Scott Pelley: As Ukraine succeeds on the battlefield, Vladimir Putin is becoming embarrassed and

150
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,139
pushed into a corner.

151
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,089
And I wonder, Mr. President, what you would say to him if he is considering using chemical

152
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,249
or tactical nuclear weapons.

153
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:18,230
President Joe Biden: Don't.

154
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,230
Don't.

155
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,230
Don't.

156
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,309
You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.

157
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,750
Scott Pelley: And the consequences of that would be what?

158
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,459
President Joe Biden: I am not going to speculate-- Scott Pelley: What would the U.S. response

159
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:31,459
be?

160
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,699
President Joe Biden: You think I would tell you if I knew exactly what it would be?

161
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,779
Of course, I'm not gonna tell you.

162
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,779
It'll be consequential.

163
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,950
They'll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been.

164
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,550
And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.

165
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,560
On the same day we spoke to the president, Putin met with China's leader, Xi Jinping.

166
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,999
There's concern that Russia's attempt to force reunification with Ukraine could inspire China

167
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,880
to attack the island of Taiwan.

168
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:10,829
U.S. policy since 1979 has been to recognize Taiwan as part of China, but remain silent

169
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:16,300
on whether the U.S. military would defend the democratic government there.

170
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,360
This is among the places where our interview runs into controversy.

171
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:27,509
Scott Pelley: What should Chinese President Xi know about your commitment to Taiwan?

172
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,179
President Joe Biden: We agree with what we signed onto a long time ago.

173
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:37,369
And that there's one China policy, and Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence.

174
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,889
We are not moving-- we're not encouraging their being independent.

175
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,720
We're not-- that-- that's their decision.

176
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,009
Scott Pelley: But would U.S. Forces defend the island?

177
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,990
President Joe Biden: Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.

178
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,149
After our interview a White House official told us U.S. policy has not changed.

179
00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:01,279
Officially, the U.S. will not say whether American forces would defend Taiwan.

180
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,189
But the commander-in-chief had a view of his own.

181
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:10,319
Scott Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would

182
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,730
defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?

183
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,720
President Joe Biden: Yes.

184
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,329
For the first time, Mr. Biden spoke about the classified documents that the FBI found

185
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,529
in former President Trump's home.

186
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,800
The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation.

187
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,890
Scott Pelley: Have you been briefed, sir, on the top-secret documents that were found

188
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,890
at Mar-a-Lago?

189
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,120
President Joe Biden: No.

190
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,610
Scott Pelley: No one has come to you to warn you that important national security secrets

191
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,309
were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former president's home?

192
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,800
President Joe Biden: I have not personally spoken to anyone on that-- in that regard.

193
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,309
I'm sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council.

194
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,309
But I have not.

195
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:01,079
Scott Pelley: were you notified of the FBI's execution of a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago?

196
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,579
President Joe Biden: No.

197
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,600
Not ahead of time.

198
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,949
The FBI spread the documents out on a floor to make a record of what was found.

199
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:15,970
Scott Pelley: When you saw the photograph of the top-secret documents laid out on the

200
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,709
floor at Mar-a-Lago, what did you think to yourself?

201
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,830
Looking at that image.

202
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,569
President Joe Biden: How that could possibly happen.

203
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,769
How one-- anyone could be that irresponsible.

204
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,589
And I thought What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods?

205
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,730
By that I mean names of people who helped or th-- et cetera.

206
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,369
And it just-- totally irresponsible.

207
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:43,490
Scott Pelley: And you don't know what was in those documents?

208
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,480
President Joe Biden: I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,269
don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should

210
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,610
move or not move on certain actions they could take.

211
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,329
I-- I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them

212
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:20,610
how to prosecute or not.

213
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,170
At the White House last Thursday, President Biden told us he hopes to retain control of

214
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,499
the House and the Senate in the midterm election in November.

215
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:36,790
But given the President's job approval rating of around 40% that remains to be seen.

216
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,239
For his part, Mr. Biden has said he plans to run again in 2024, but here is another

217
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,499
place where our interview may cause controversy.

218
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:58,490
Scott Pelley: Sir, are you committed to running again, or are there certain conditions that

219
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,490
have to be right?

220
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,070
President Joe Biden: Look, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden,

221
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,949
a whole range of things come into play that I have-- requirements I have to change and

222
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:07,949
move and do.

223
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:08,949
Scott Pelley: In terms of election laws?

224
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,329
President Joe Biden: In terms of election laws.

225
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,980
And it's much too early to make that kind of decision.

226
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,160
I'm a great respecter of fate.

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,370
And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job.

228
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,410
I'm gonna do that job.

229
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,399
And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going

230
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,529
into next year, make a judgment on what to do.

231
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,350
Scott Pelley: You say that it's much too early to make that decision.

232
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,209
I take it the decision has not been made in your own head.

233
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,430
President Joe Biden: Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again.

234
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,170
But it's just an intention.

235
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,220
But is it a firm decision that I run again?

236
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,569
That remains to be seen.

237
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:50,329
Scott Pelley: Mr. President, you are the oldest president ever.

238
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,779
President Joe Biden: Pretty good shape, huh?

239
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,369
Scott Pelley: Which leads to my next question.

240
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:57,790
You are more aware of this than anyone.

241
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,600
Some people ask whether you are fit for the job.

242
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,589
And when you hear that, I wonder what you think.

243
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,110
President Joe Biden: Watch me.

244
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,709
And ma-- honest to God, that's all I think.

245
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,079
Watch me.

246
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,170
If you think I don't have the energy level or the mental acuity, then-- then, you know,

247
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,429
that's one thing.

248
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:22,100
It's another thing, you just watch and-- and, you know, keep my schedule.

249
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,689
Do what I'm doing.

250
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,959
I-- I think that-- you know-- I don't-- when I sit down with our NATO allies and keep 'em

251
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,949
together, I don't have 'em saying, "Wait a minute, w-- how-- how old are you?

252
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:31,949
What are you-- what say?"

253
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:38,009
You know, I mean, it's a matter of, you know, that old expression: The proof of the pudding's

254
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,009
in the eating.

255
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:44,259
I mean, I-- I-- I respect the fact that people would say, you know, "You're old."

256
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:50,250
And-- but I think it relates to h-- how much energy you have, and whether or not the job

257
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,059
you're doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do.

258
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,859
Scott Pelley: How would you say your mental focus is?

259
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:00,410
President Joe Biden: Oh, it's focused.

260
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:07,149
I'd say it's-- I think it's-- I-- I haven't-- look, I have trouble even mentioning, even

261
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,980
saying to myself, my own head, the number of years.

262
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,179
I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly.

263
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:20,879
I mean, it's just not-- I haven't-- observed anything in terms of-- there's not things

264
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,869
I don't do now that I did before, whether it's physical, or mental, or anything else.

265
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:31,029
Scott Pelley: You have had a string of legislative successes recently.

266
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,939
President Joe Biden: How'd an old guy do that?

267
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:42,109
Scott Pelley: But your approval rating in the country is well below 50%.

268
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,779
And I wonder why you think that is.

269
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,029
President Joe Biden: This is a really difficult time.

270
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,649
We're at an inflection point in the history of this country.

271
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,239
We're gonna make decisions, and we're making decisions now, that are gonna determine what

272
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:57,160
we're gonna look like the next ten years from now.

273
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:05,050
I think you'd agree that the impact on the psyche of the American people as a consequence

274
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,690
of the pandemic is profound.

275
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,880
Think of how that has changed everything.

276
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,770
You know, people's attitudes about themselves, their families, about the state of the nation,

277
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,019
about the state of their communities.

278
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,250
And so there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a great deal of uncertainty.

279
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,380
And we lost a million people.

280
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,660
A million people to COVID.

281
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,919
When I got in office, when I-- I got elected, only 2 million people had been vaccinated.

282
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,980
I got 220 million-- m-- my point is it takes time.

283
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,169
We were left in a very difficult situation.

284
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,320
it's been a very difficult time.

285
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,220
Very difficult.

286
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,860
And a difficult life for the president.

287
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,510
In 1972 he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident.

288
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,980
He lost his son, Beau, to cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.

289
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,510
And his son, Hunter, has been a lightning rod for suspicion.

290
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:10,000
Hunter Biden's former addiction to crack cocaine led to a life he describes as "non-stop depravity."

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,710
He has also acknowledged a federal investigation into his taxes.

292
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,889
Congress investigated Hunter Biden's job with a Ukrainian company at the time that his father

293
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:24,900
ran Ukrainian policy in the Obama administration.

294
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,269
A Republican investigation, however, uncovered no wrongdoing by then-Vice President Biden.

295
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:38,510
Scott Pelley: Mr. President, if you run again, Republicans are most likely to go after your

296
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,169
son Hunter once again.

297
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:50,100
And I wonder what you would like to say about your son and whether any of his troubles have

298
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,269
caused conflicts for you or for the United States.

299
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,539
President Joe Biden: I love my son, number one.

300
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,179
He fought-- an addiction problem.

301
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:03,179
He overcame it.

302
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,550
He wrote about it.

303
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,100
And no, there's not a single thing that I've observed at all from th-- that would affect

304
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,990
me or the United States relative to my son Hunter.

305
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,909
Republican investigations are likely to resume if Mr. Biden loses either the House or the

306
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,640
Senate, and history shows that presidents usually lose seats in Congress in a midterm

307
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
election.

308
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,360
If so, the president's remaining ambitions may be beyond his reach.

309
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,720
President Joe Biden: For example, we passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years,

310
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,899
although I'm not gonna rest till we get assault weapons banned, which I did once before when

311
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:42,899
I was a senator.

312
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:43,899
Scott Pelley: Assault weapons banned?

313
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,809
President Joe Biden: Assault-- assault weapons banned.

314
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,510
There's no rationale.

315
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,190
Deer aren't running through the woods wearing Kevlar vests.

316
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:58,900
Scott Pelley: Somebody came in and told you about Uvalde when it happened, and I wonder

317
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,970
what you thought.

318
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,509
President Joe Biden: Again, I've gone to every one of those places.

319
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:10,120
And in Uvalde, I spent time with every sing-- four hours.

320
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:18,290
Four hours in the pain, pain, and it's just so, so unnecessary.

321
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,650
So wrong.

322
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,350
Who the hell m-- (SIGH) don't get me going.

323
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,360
But I met with every one of those families and i-- and-- and the extended families for

324
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,990
four hours.

325
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,870
look, our kids should be learning how to read and write, not duck and cover.

326
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,179
Think about that.

327
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,350
Think of the mental impact on these kids going back to school.

328
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,250
We saw it.

329
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,510
It's wrong.

330
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,779
It's wrong.

331
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,390
It's not who we are.

332
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,960
And we've gotta stop it.

333
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,669
We've got to stop it.

334
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:59,669
And the NRA continuing to push the sale of-- assault and semiautomatic weapons is bizarre.

335
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:05,639
The much more modest bi-partisan gun law that passed this summer may be the best example

336
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,960
of the president's legislative breakthroughs that no one thought possible.

337
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,139
"How'd an old guy do that?"

338
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,850
He asked us earlier.

339
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,490
We have a theory.

340
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,570
Joe Biden is among the longest-serving politicians in Washington.

341
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,360
If there is less bounce in the step than there once was, if the words don't flow like they

342
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:34,100
used to, maybe there's something to be said for knowhow—five decades on the Hill and

343
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
in the Oval.

344
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:41,669
Scott Pelley: Concerning politics, Mr. President, you were elected to the Senate in 1972.

345
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:42,860
You were 29 years old.

346
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:53,730
And in those days, it seemed that the parties worked together to move the country forward.

347
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:00,299
And I think many Americans feel that that no longer happens, and, in fact, may be impossible

348
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,299
now.

349
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,750
President Joe Biden: Well, I don't think it's impossible.

350
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,669
But it-- it-- it's changed.

351
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:08,580
What we do today, think about it, it's all personal attacks.

352
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,809
It's about motive.

353
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,860
It's not about, "I disagree with you on the-- on the subject matter.

354
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:21,659
And secondly, I think that-- it's-- I think it's fair to say that we've not had a president

355
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,130
like the last president, who has made all of it so personal.

356
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,321
I've had six Republican senators, I promised I'd never say their names and I won't, come

357
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:35,779
up to me in the last two years and say, "Joe, I agree with you, but if I-- if I vote this

358
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:37,909
way it's gonna-- they're gonna primary me.

359
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm gonna lose an election."

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
It didn't used to be that way.

361
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,429
But it's coming back a little bit.

362
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,429
It's coming back.

363
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,500
Scott Pelley: Do you see it?

364
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,529
It seems to me, Mr. President, that-- when you were-- first came to the Senate, the other

365
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,929
guy had a bad idea, and now the other guy is a bad guy.

366
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,620
And I don't know how you get back to that-- President Joe Biden: Well, I'll tell you what,

367
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,840
think about this.

368
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,850
I was able to get-- we were able to get a bipartisan $1.2 trillion package done for

369
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,670
dealing with the whole question of rebuilding the country, the roads and the highways.

370
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,269
the fact of the matter is we've gotten a lot of things done bipartisanly.

371
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:20,460
And everybody said, "We're not gonna do anything, don't let Biden have any successes," et cetera.

372
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,630
So it's still a way to go, but I think we're making some progress.

373
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,669
Scott Pelley: You have lived a long life of triumph and tragedy.

374
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,299
In November you'll be 80.

375
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,480
And I wonder what it is that keeps you in the arena.

376
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,800
President Joe Biden: Well, look-- I've had tragedies.

377
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,870
I've lost part of my soul when I lost my son Beau, I lost my wife and my daughter in an

378
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,870
accident.

379
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,190
I think of all the people who've gone through what I've gone through and a lot more without

380
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,190
what I had.

381
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,830
I have had incredibly supportive family.

382
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,130
There's so many, literally, heroes getting up every day putting one foot in front of

383
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:10,910
the other with no help, I constantly think what would Beau want me to do?

384
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,230
What would-- and, you know, this gets me a long way, this rosary.

385
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,030
Catholic and devout, he keeps a rosary in his pocket.

386
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:26,529
And he showed us his other inspiration in a cartoon that his father had framed.

387
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:33,889
In it, the viking, Hagar, confronts God after a lighting strike—a blow like those endured

388
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,889
by the president.

389
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,379
President Joe Biden: And he's looking up, and what's he say?

390
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,070
He says, "Why me, God?"

391
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,960
And the next scene, a voice from heaven, "Why not?"

392
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
That's my dad.

393
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
"Why not, Joey?

394
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Why not you?

395
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,150
Why not-- what makes you so different?

396
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,559
Just get up."

397
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,139
My mom's expression was, "Just get up.

398
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,399
Get up.

399
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,399
Get up."

400
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,039
Scott Pelley: And you feel you have more to give.

401
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,720
President Joe Biden: A lot more to give.

402
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,769
A lot more to give.
